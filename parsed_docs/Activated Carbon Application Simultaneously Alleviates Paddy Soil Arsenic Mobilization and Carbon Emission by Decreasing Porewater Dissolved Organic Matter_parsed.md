The porewater dissolved organic matter (DOM) molecular composition was determined using Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) and analyzed using the in-house Matlab script TRFu. DOM was extracted from the porewater of the three treatments using solid phase extraction (SPE). FTICR–MS spectra were measured by a Bruker SolariX mass spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) equipped with a 15.0 T superconducting magnet with electrospray ionization (ESI) in negative ion mode, with m/z from 100 to 1600 Da. The molecular formula classification of FT-ICR MS data was listed in Table S4 below.

## 7.8 Characterization of electronic donating capacity (EDC) and Fe(II) content of pot experiment soils

At 137 d of the first-year pot experiment, upper layer (3-7 cm) and lower layer (13-17 cm) soils were sampled from the pots and transferred into the glovebox within a few seconds. Three 1.00 g subsamples were weighed into 15 mL centrifuge tubes. Then, 10 mL of 1 M HCl, 10 mL of 6 M HCl, and 10 mL of ferricyanide solutions (10 mM potassium ferricyanide, 3 M NaCl, and 100 mM phosphate buffer) were sequentially spiked into the centrifuge tubes, which were then transferred in a glovebox. After 5, 6, and 24 h of reaction in the glovebox, the samples were analyzed to quantify the low-crystalline Fe(II) and Fe(III) content, high-crystalline Fe(II) and Fe(III) content, and electron-donating capacity of these pot soils, respectively. Afterward, the supernatant samples were taken out and filtered using a 0.22 μm membrane filter. The filtrates were measured spectrophotometrically at 510 nm and 420 nm as soon as possible to determine the Fe(II)/Fe(III) content and electron accumulation capacity of the soils, respectively. The rest of the soil was dried to determine water content of the soils.

## 16S rRNA Gene Amplicon Sequencing and Data Analysis

During the two-year pot experiments, the soil samples were collected at 40, 75, and 120 days in the first year and 131 days in the second year and stored in a -80°C refrigerator. The soil FastDNA Spin Kit (MP Biomedicals, USA) was used to extract soil DNA. PCR amplification of the bacterial 16S rRNA genes V3–V4 region was performed using the forward primer 338F (5'-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCA-3') and the reverse primer 806R (5'-GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT-3'). Sample-specific 7-bp barcodes were incorporated into the primers for multiplex sequencing.

The PCR components contained:
- 5 μL of buffer (5×)
- 0.25 μL of Fast pfu DNA Polymerase (5U/μL)
- 2 μL (2.5 mM) of dNTPs
- 1 μL (10 μM) of each Forward and Reverse primer
- 1 μL of DNA Template
- 14.75 μL of H₂O

Thermal cycling consisted of initial denaturation at 98°C for 2 minutes, followed by 25 cycles consisting of denaturation at 98°C for 15 seconds, annealing at 55°C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72°C for 30 seconds, with a final extension of 5 minutes at 72°C. PCR amplicons were purified with Vazyme VAHTS™ DNA Clean Beads (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) and quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). After the individual quantification step, amplicons were pooled in equal amounts, and paired-end 250 bp sequencing was performed using the Illumina NovaSeq platform with the NovaSeq 6000 SP Reagent Kit (500 cycles) at Shanghai Personal Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China).

Sequence data analyses were mainly performed using QIIME2 and R packages (v3.2.0). ASV-level alpha diversity indices, including Chao1, observed species, Phylogenetic diversity (PD) Whole Tree Shannon index, and Simpson index were calculated using the ASV table in QIIME2. ASV-level ranked abundance curves were generated to compare the richness and evenness of ASVs among samples. Beta diversity analysis was performed to investigate the structural variation of microbial communities across samples using Jaccard metrics, Bray-Curtis metrics, and UniFrac distance metrics, as well as visualized via nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means (UPGMA) hierarchical clustering. The raw sequence data are deposited in the National Genomics Data Center (NGDC) (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa) (GSA: CRA015577).

## Analysis of total As and some nutrients and trace elements concentration and arsenic speciation in rice grains

Powdered subsamples (0.1 g) of over-dried grain samples were digested with 5 mL of high-purity concentrated HNO₃ using a graphite digestion device. Total As and some nutrients and trace elements (P, Fe, Cd, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Ca) in grain and husk was determined by inductively coupled plasma−mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, PerkinElmer NexION 2000). The 1% HNO₃ acid extraction method was used to extract arsenic speciation in rice grains. In brief, powdered subsamples (0.2 g) were weighed and extracted with 10 mL of 1% high-purity HNO₃. Gradient from room temperature to 75 ℃ with holding times of 10 min, then to 95 ℃ with holding times of 30 min. After digestion, the extracts were centrifuged at 3214 g for 10 min and filtered through a 0.22 μm membrane. As species in grain were separated and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography−inductively coupled plasma−mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS, PerkinElmer NexION 2000). Chromatographic separations were performed using a commonly used HPLC system with an anion exchange column. A Hamilton PRP-X100 column (length, 250 mm; diameter, 4.1 mm) was used with an isocratic phosphate/nitrate eluent (15 mM NH₄H₂PO₄ and 15 mM NH₄NO₃, pH 6.0) and a flow rate of 1.0 mL min⁻¹.

## Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 Reduction of Ferrihydrite Experiment

### Preparation of Ferrihydrite
Ferrihydrite was synthesized using the method described by Amstaetter et al. The synthesized product was washed with ultrapure water and suspended in ultrapure water to achieve a concentration of 200 mM Fe(III). The suspension was then deoxygenated by stirring and N₂ purging for 2 hours. Finally, the suspension was stored in the dark in serum bottles sealed with a thick butyl rubber stopper and aluminum crimp.

### Microbial Cultivation
A pure culture of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 (ATCC No. 700550) was aerobically cultured in Luria-Bertani medium under temperature-controlled conditions (28°C, 150 rpm) for 14-16 hours. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7000 rpm for 5 min, washed with anoxic bicarbonate buffer (30 mM, pH 7.0), and re-suspended at a density of approximately 2 × 10¹¹ cells mL⁻¹.

## S6 Fitting method

CO₂ and CH₄ accumulation in soil microcosm incubations. We used these concentrations to determine total concentrations of CO₂ or CH₄ in the gas and aqueous phase (CCO₂,CH₄,total,t) per gram of soil at each sampling point t using Eq. 1.

\[
CCO_{2,4,total,t} = \frac{nCO_{2,CH₄,(g),t} + nCO_{2,CH₄,(aq),t}}{DW} \tag{1}
\]

where \(nCO_{2,CH₄,(g),t}\) and \(nCO_{2,CH₄,(aq),t}\) are the moles of CO₂ or CH₄ in the gas and aqueous phase, respectively, at time t, and DW is the dry weight of the soil.

The value of \(nCO_{2,CH₄,(g),t}\) was determined directly from the measured concentration of CO₂ or CH₄ (CCO₂,CH₄,(g),t, in ppmv) following Eq. 2.

\[
nCO_{2,CH₄,(g),t} = \frac{CCO_{2,4,(g),t} \times 10^6}{V_{headspace}} \tag{2}
\]

where \(V_{headspace}\) is the headspace volume in the reactor and is equal to 63.5 mL. \(V_m\) is the molar volume of gas and is equal to 24.7 L mol⁻¹ at 28 ℃, and 1.01×10⁵ Pa. Note that the factor \(10^{-6}\) reflects the transformation of ppmv to volume fraction.

We assumed the gas and liquid phase to be in equilibrium and determined \(nCO_{2,CH₄,(aq),t}\) using Henry’s law Eq. 3.

\[
nCO_{2,CH₄,(aq),t} = CCO_{2,4,(g),t} \times 10^6 \times K_H \times V_{suspension} \tag{3}
\]

where \(CCO_{2,CH₄,(g),t} \times 10^6\) is the partial pressure of CO₂ or CH₄ at time t (in atm), assuming partial pressure equals volume fraction times experimental pressure of 1 atm, and \(K_H\) is the Henry constant for CO₂ (0.0341 mol L⁻¹ atm⁻¹) or CH₄ (0.0015 M mol L⁻¹ atm⁻¹) at experimental conditions of 1 atm pressure and 298 K.

## Section 7.8: Soil Microcosm Incubations

### 7.8.1 Fe(III) Reduction Rate

The concentration of CO₂ or CH₄ produced until time t was calculated by adding concentrations at time t to cumulative concentrations at the preceding sampling point.

Fe(III) reduction rate in soil microcosm incubations. Logistic and exponential models were used to simulate the relationship between Fe(II) accumulation and incubation time in each treatment by Origin 2023. The logistic model can be expressed as:

\[ Y_t = \frac{1}{1 + ae^{-ct}} \tag{4} \]

where, \( Y_t \) is the Fe(II) concentration measured after incubation for \( t \) (d); and \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are the parameters in this formula. The derivative of \( Y_t \) is:

\[ V = \frac{dY^t}{dt} = Y_t \cdot c \cdot (1 - Y_t) \tag{5} \]

The derivative of \( V \) is:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( dY^t \right) = Y_t \cdot c^2 \cdot (1 - 3Y^t + 2Y_t^2) \tag{6} \]

When the derivative of \( V \) is zero, it means that the Fe(III) reduction rate reaches the maximum. Then the value for \( Y_t \) can be calculated according to Eq. 6 and is equal to \( 0.5a \). The value for \( Y_t \) can be used in Eq. 5 to obtain \( V_{max} \), which is equal to \( 0.25ac \). The Fe(III) reduction rate in the manuscript refers to \( V_{max} \).

### 7.8.2 Electron Accumulation Rate

Electron accumulation rate in soil microcosm incubations. The method to fit the electron accumulation rate is the same as the method used for fitting the iron reduction rate. The electron accumulation rate in the manuscript refers to \( V_{max} \).

### 7.8.3 CO₂ Emission Rate

CO₂ emission rate in soil microcosm incubations. To obtain CO₂ emission rate,

## Section 7.8: CO₂ Emission Rate Calculation

We fit CO₂ accumulation to Eq. 7 by Origin 2023, which normalized to dry soil grams (CCO₂,cum,t).

### Equation 7
\[ CCO₂,cum,t = a (1 - e^{-bt}) \]

Where \( a \) and \( b \) are parameters optimized in the fit and \( t \) is time. The parameters \( a \) and \( b \) were subsequently used in the derivative of the above function to calculate initial CO₂ emission rate at \( t = 1 \, d \) (\( RCO₂,t=1d \)) according to Eq. 8.

### Equation 8
\[ RCO₂,t = a b e^{bt} \]

The CO₂ emission rate in the manuscript refers to initial CO₂ emission rate at \( t = 1 \, d \). As release rate in soil microcosm incubations was obtained by linear regression from the steepest slopes of the As release curve.

### Ferrihydrite Reduction Rate
Ferrihydrite reduction rate in Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 incubations. Ferrihydrite reduction rate in pure culture incubations was acquired by linear regression from the steepest slopes of the Fe(II) accumulation curve.

## 7.8 Pot Soil Microbial Community Dynamics

Insignificant change of alpha diversity indexes among different treatments at different rice growth stages demonstrated AC and RC amendments did not affect community richness, community diversity, and phylogenetic diversity (Table S3, SI). Insignificant differences were observed for AC, RC and CK treatments at the phylum level (Fig. S10a, SI). Bacterial community in CK treatment closely associated with RC treatment but obviously separated from AC treatment (Fig. S10b, SI). But further taxonomical classification at the genus level revealed few significant changes in potential Fe(III) reducers (Fig. S10c, SI). These results demonstrated the decreased porewater DOM in AC treatment did not significantly alter microbial growth but possibly affect microbial metabolic activities. Biochar insignificantly impacts flooding paddy soil microbial community composition has also been reported previously.

## Figure S14

EEM spectra of DOM before and after AC/RC adsorption. Emission-excitation matrix spectra characterization of soil extracted DOM fluorescent property with AC/RC amended. Ten grams soil was mixed with 20 mL Milli-Q water and shaken for 30 min to extract DOM. AC and RC (2 g L⁻¹) were added to the DOM solution and shaken for 1 h. The resultant supernatant was filtered and collected for EEM characterization: soil extracted DOM (a), supernatant after AC adsorption (b), and supernatant after RC adsorption (c). The fluorescence intensity of protein-like components and humic-like peak A in three treatments was shown in the bar plots (d).

Figure S15: Calculated porewater DOM quinone content. Normalized Fe(III) reduction rates in response to different content of electron shuttles, including porewater DOM, AQDS, groundwater humic acid (HA), and groundwater fluvic acid (FA). Normalized Fe(III) reduction rate was calculated from the electron shuttle mediated microbial Fe(III) reduction kinetic result. Porewater DOM related data were performed in this study. AQDS, HA, and FA related data were acquired from Wolf et al. study. Linear fitting slopes for porewater DOM, AQDS, HA, and FA mediated microbial Fe(III) reduction were 0.777, 2.48, 0.669, and 1.28, respectively. Accordingly, porewater DOM quinone content was approximately one-third of that in AQDS, with a value of 0.024 mol quinone/mol C.
