# ROLE OF HYDROGEN IN DECARBONIZATION: ENERGY POLICIES AND STRATEGIES FOR TRANSITION

## Abstract
This study aims to optimize hydrogen (H₂) production via ethanol steam reforming (ESR) and water gas shift reaction (WGSR) pathways, focusing on minimizing CO₂, CO, and CH₄ emissions while maximizing H₂ yield. Employing Taguchi grey relational analysis, we investigate the intricate balance between production conditions and multi-response gas generation. Utilizing Origin Pro software, regression modeling forecasts individual and overall gas generation. Our analysis identifies optimal conditions: a feed liquid flow rate of 2 mL/min, water-to-carbon ratio of 3, ESR temperature of 300 °C, and WGSR temperature of 350 °C. These conditions promise clean, efficient H₂ production. Key results show the water-to-carbon ratio and ESR temperature contributing 59.22% and 32.69% to production conditions’ impact, respectively. Graphical and mathematical models validate these findings. Moving forward, further experimental validation of optimal conditions for multi-response gas generation is recommended. This study pioneers a transformative approach towards sustainable, environmentally friendly H₂ production.

In a city battling pollution, two solutions emerged: carbon capture and utilization (CCU) and carbon reduction optimization (CRO). CCU captured emissions from factories, repurposing them for various uses. Meanwhile, CRO-optimized processes reduce emissions at their source. While CCU seemed effective, CRO’s proactive approach proved superior. By targeting emissions directly, CRO minimized the need for extensive infrastructure and promoted sustainable practices. Ultimately, CRO led to cleaner air and a brighter future for the city.

In the expansive realm of sustainable energy, an array of diverse endeavors has been undertaken to grapple with the pressing issue of emissions during hydrogen production from traditional sources such as water gas shift reaction (WGSR) and ethanol steam reforming (ESR). Casanovas et al. (2009) conducted a comprehensive study delving into the investigation of Mn promotion over Co/ZnO catalysts for ethanol steam reforming and water gas shift reactions, unraveling intricate insights into catalyst characteristics and performance. Nevertheless, amidst its elucidation, a conspicuous lacuna emerges, as it overlooks the crucial aspect of optimizing hydrogen production and minimizing carbon emissions, thereby constituting a significant drawback. This oversight underscores missed opportunities to enhance process efficiency and bolster environmental sustainability.

On a similar note, Sharma et al. (2017) eloquently underscored ethanol steam reforming’s potential for hydrogen production, yet astutely noted a glaring absence in optimization for hydrogen yield and reduction of carbon emissions, accentuating the exigency for more holistic strategies. Additionally, Chen et al. (2017) singularly focused on hydrogen generation from ESR and WGSR techniques, regrettably sidestepping the imperative of addressing carbon emission reduction, thus magnifying environmental apprehensions. This recurrent theme of neglecting carbon emission mitigation alongside hydrogen yield optimization, as exemplified in Quan et al.’s (2024) evaluation of Ni–Ce/mesopore Y catalysts for ESR, speaks volumes about the prevailing trend in the literature.

Furthermore, Cordaro et al.’s (2024) proposition of a model for co-generating hydrogen and electricity unveils a pertinent concern—its oversight in optimizing both hydrogen and carbon emissions, underscoring an inherent deficiency in overall efficiency and sustainability considerations. While Di Nardo et al. (2024) provided a nuanced analysis of CO₂ emissions across diverse steam reforming processes, their failure to optimize hydrogen yield and carbon emissions is a palpable shortcoming that merits attention. Similarly, Kim et al.’s (2024) exploration into enhancing hydrogen production from waste-derived syngas signals a clear imperative for further optimization in both hydrogen yield and carbon minimization.

Ovalle-Encinia and Lin’s (2024) investigation of a CO₂-perm-selective membrane reactor for WGS reaction, albeit demonstrating enhanced CO conversion and H₂ purity, notably disregarded optimization for hydrogen production.

In conclusion, while the literature has extensively explored methods such as water–gas shift (WGS) reaction and ethanol steam reforming for hydrogen production, a notable gap remains in the simultaneous optimization of hydrogen yield and carbon emissions reduction. Our work stands out by addressing this gap and introducing novel strategies to integrate Taguchi design and grey relational analysis. By leveraging these techniques, we aim to maximize hydrogen production while minimizing carbon emissions from carbon-sourced hydrogen. This approach represents a significant advancement in the field, offering a more environmentally sustainable solution.

## Methodology

The data analyzed in this study is derived from the study of Chen et al. (2017), and here is the summary of the conditions employed to obtain the data from their work: The system employed included the experimentation of producing hydrogen and enriching carbon dioxide. It included a feeding unit, a reaction unit, a condenser, and units for gas and liquid analysis. Ethanol–water mix in a flask was fed using a pump. The reaction unit had ESR and WGSR.

### Taguchi design analysis

For the trials, a Taguchi L9 orthogonal array (OA) was used, comprising nine runs as indicated in Table 1. Four response factors, CO, CO₂, CH₄, and H₂, were used to evaluate the gases produced, as shown in Table 1. The results and models generated for the four gases are presented and discussed in “Results and discussion.” Like the study of Abifarin and Owolabi (2023), note that the production conditions employed are labeled A to D (Table 1) for the mathematical modeling of resultant gases discussed in “Results and discussion.” The design overview is depicted in Fig. 1.

## Multi-gas response optimization using GRA

The Taguchi design of experiments (DOE) method is adequate for evaluating optimal processing parameters for a single performance response. However, when optimizing two or more responses, a multi-objective optimization technique is necessary. Grey relational analysis (GRA) is employed to handle irregular finite data by normalizing all four gases into a single domain for Taguchi optimization analysis. Therefore, multi-gas optimization of processing parameters is conducted using the Taguchi GRA technique.

### Grey relational analysis

The preprocessing of the four experimental gas data was done to ensure that they fell between zero and one, as stated in the grey relational analysis technique. The “higher-the-better” preprocessing data methodology was applied to H₂, whereas the “smaller-the-better” method was applied to CO₂ and CH₄. The reason for this choice is that a higher quantity of H₂ is desired for fuel efficiency maximization, while as small as possible CO₂ and CH₄ emissions are desired for emission reduction.

For each of the four generated gases, an ideal sequence, \( x^0(k) = 1, 2,…, 9 \), was compared. The grey relational coefficient is calculated as follows:

\[
\Delta o_i(k) = \| x^0(k) - x_i(k) \| \tag{3}
\]

## Results and Discussion

### Hydrogen (H₂) Maximization Analysis

#### Significance of Hydrogen Production Conditions on Hydrogen Generation

The results from **Table 3** highlight the significant influence of various hydrogen production conditions on the yield of H₂. Specifically, the water-to-carbon ratio emerges as the most influential factor, contributing 50.88% to the maximization of H₂ yield. This underscores the importance of maintaining an optimal ratio of water to carbon for efficient hydrogen production in ethanol steam reforming (ESR) and water gas shift reaction (WGSR) pathways. Additionally, the rate of feed liquid flow and ESR temperature each contribute significantly to H₂ yield, indicating their substantial impact on the process. Conversely, WGSR exhibits the lowest contribution, accounting for only 12.69% of H₂ yield variation. These findings emphasize the necessity of prioritizing the water-to-carbon ratio as a key production condition for maximizing hydrogen output in ESR and WGSR processes.

The effectiveness of the model is further confirmed by a residual error of zero, validating its accuracy in predicting H₂ generation under varying production conditions. Equation 6 mathematically represents the relationship between production conditions and H₂ yield, with variables A, B, C, D denoting the resultant H₂ values corresponding to feed liquid flow rate, water-to-carbon ratio, ESR temperature, and WGSR temperature, respectively. This comprehensive analysis elucidates the critical role of process parameters in influencing hydrogen production efficiency and underscores the importance of optimizing conditions to enhance overall process performance.

H₂(%) = 55.69 + 0.338A + 1.25B + 0.0158C − 0.00029D

### Effect of Hydrogen Production Conditions on Hydrogen Production

The interaction between hydrogen production conditions and their impact on H₂ generation is crucial for maximizing production efficiency. Illustrated in **Fig. 2**, the varying shades from deep red to deep blue denote the spectrum of H₂ levels, with deep red representing the highest and deep blue the lowest. Ideally, production conditions yielding a deep red hue indicate optimal H₂ generation. Consequently, a higher water-to-carbon (H₂O/C) ratio and ESR temperature, in conjunction with other hydrogen production conditions, lead to maximal H₂ production. Conversely, lower values of feed liquid flow rate and WGSR temperature contribute to optimal H₂ yield, while also offering energy-saving benefits. Therefore, by precisely controlling production conditions as guided by the model depicted in **Fig. 2** and Equation 6, maximum hydrogen production can be achieved via ethanol steam reforming and water gas shift reaction pathways. This underscores the importance of strategic process parameter management in enhancing all process performance.

The effects of these production conditions on CO generation influence CO generation, providing valuable insights for optimizing hydrogen production pathways while minimizing unwanted byproducts like CO. Utilizing ANOVA analysis, Table 4 provides insights into the percentage contribution of each production condition to CO generation. The results highlight the significant impact of the rate of feed liquid flow, contributing 50.77%, followed by the water-to-carbon ratio at 32.95%. Remarkably, the residual error exhibits zero contribution, indicating the model’s exceptional goodness of fit. Regression modeling facilitated the development of a mathematical model for CO generation, as presented in Eq. 7, where variables A, B, C, and D correspond to the resultant generated values of CO gas concerning the rate of feed liquid flow, H2O/C ratio, ESR temperature, and WGSR temperature, respectively. This comprehensive analysis underscores the critical role of production conditions in CO generation.

## Figure 3
Interaction between the production parameters on carbon monoxide reduction

Notably, deep red hues signify higher CO levels, while deep blue hues denote lower CO levels. Overall, the results reveal that a high water-to-carbon (H₂O/C) ratio coupled with a lower rate of feed liquid flow tends to result in lower CO generation when interacting with other production conditions. Interestingly, the figure illustrates that different ESR and WGSR temperatures can minimize CO generation. Specifically, employing lower temperatures, such as 400 °C for ESR and 300 °C for WGSR, can yield minimal CO generation, suggesting relatively low energy costs required to mitigate CO production. This graphical modeling for CO generation offers valuable insights for researchers and production engineers, enabling them to manipulate various production conditions to minimize CO generation when producing hydrogen via ethanol steam reforming and water gas shift reaction pathways.

## Effect of Hydrogen Production Conditions on the Generation of Carbon Dioxide

Similar to the CO reduction analysis, the effect of hydrogen production conditions on CO₂ generation was investigated, and the interaction between these conditions on the resulting percentage of CO₂ was simulated, as shown in Fig. 4. The different color outlets reflect variations in CO₂ percentages, with deep red indicating the highest level of CO₂ and deep blue indicating the lowest level. In contrast to CO generation, when a low value of water-to-carbon (H₂O/C) ratio and a high value of the rate of feed liquid flow interact with other production conditions, lower CO₂ generation is observed. Additionally, a higher value of ESR temperature results in lower CO₂ generation. The results further reveal that WGSR temperature in the range of 320 to 370 °C yields relatively low CO₂ levels, indicating a lesser WGSR energy cost to produce hydrogen with minimal CO₂ generation. These modeled production conditions presented in the figure provide a pathway to optimizing lower CO₂ generation.

Effect of hydrogen production conditions on the generation of methane. Interestingly, it was found that both lower and higher WGSR temperature ranges can yield minimum CH₄ values. However, to save on hydrogen production costs and minimize CH₄, a WGSR temperature as low as 300 °C is recommended. This graphical model aids in decision-making regarding CH₄ minimization during hydrogen production from ethanol steam reforming and water gas shift reaction pathways. Different color outlets in the figure represent variations in CH₄ percentages, where deep red indicates the highest level of CH₄ and deep blue indicates the lowest.

It was observed that higher values of the water-to-carbon (H₂O/C) ratio and ESR temperature when interacting with other hydrogen production conditions result in the minimization of CH₄. Additionally, different values of the rate of feed liquid flow interacting with other production conditions can also lead to the minimization of CH₄. This suggests that a lower liquid flow rate (for energy cost minimization) can be applied to minimize CH₄ generation during the production.

To minimize undesired gases (CO, CO₂, and CH₄) while maximizing the desired gas (H₂), Taguchi grey relational analysis effectively addresses this complexity and indecision challenge.

Figure 6a showcases the optimal conditions for minimizing CO gas, revealing a rate of feed liquid flow of 2 mL/min, water-to-carbon ratio of 4, ESR temperature of 400 °C, and WGSR temperature of 300 °C.

Figure 6b illustrates CO₂ minimization, indicating optimal conditions of a liquid flow rate of 4 mL/min, water-to-carbon ratio of 3, ESR temperature of 500 °C, and WGSR temperature of 350 °C.

For methane reduction, Figure 6c displays optimal conditions with a liquid flow rate of 3 mL/min, water-to-carbon ratio of 5, ESR temperature of 500 °C, and WGSR temperature of 400 °C.

Lastly, Figure 6d reveals the maximization of hydrogen production at optimal conditions of a liquid flow rate of 2 mL/min, water-to-carbon ratio of 3, ESR temperature of 400 °C, and WGSR temperature of 350 °C.

These observations highlight different optimal production conditions for the resultant gases, complicating conclusions on singular responses given the undesirability of carbon-based gases and the desirability of hydrogen. Consequently, the subsequent section delves into the results presented.

To comprehensively assess the significance and percentage contribution of each production condition to the multi-response gases, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted for the grey relational grade (GRG) values at a confidence level of 95%. The findings revealed that the water-to-carbon (H₂O/C) ratio emerged as the most influential production condition, with a substantial contribution of 59.22%, followed closely by the ESR temperature at 32.69%. Notably, while the WGSR temperature and rate of feed liquid flow also demonstrated significance, their contributions were comparatively lower than those of the conditions. These results offer conclusive optimized hydrogen production conditions to minimize undesired gases and maximize desired gas (H₂) production. These conditions are particularly recommended for hydrogen production via ethanol steam reforming and water gas shift reaction pathways. The observed absence of residual error in the GRA ANOVA underscores the high level of confidence in the developed model.

It is worth noting that varying the output GRG values of individual production conditions can yield different proportions of GRG, as expressed in Eq. 10. A, B, C, and D represent the resultant generated values of GRG for the rate of feed liquid flow, H₂O/C ratio, ESR temperature, and WGSR temperature, respectively.

\[ GRG = -0.463 + 0.0131A + 0.1097B + 0.001627C - 0.000419D \]
