## Abstract

Soil erosion and terrestrial deposition of soil organic carbon (SOC) can potentially play a significant role in global carbon cycling. Assessing the redistribution of SOC during erosion and subsequent transport and burial is of critical importance. Using hydrological records of soil erosion and sediment load, and compiled organic carbon (OC) data, estimates of the eroded soils and OC induced by water in the Yellow River basin during the period 1950–2010 were assembled. The Yellow River basin has experienced intense soil erosion due to combined impact of natural process and human activity. Over the period, 134.2± 24.7 Gt of soils and 1.07 ± 0.15 Gt of OC have been eroded from hillslopes based on a soil erosion rate of 1.7–2.5 Gt yr−1. Approximately 63 % of the eroded soils were deposited in the river system, while only 37 % were discharged into the ocean. For the OC budget, approximately 0.53 ±0.21 Gt (49.5 %) was buried in the river system, 0.25 ±0.14 Gt (23.5 %) was delivered into the ocean, and the remaining 0.289 ±0.294 Gt (27 %) was decomposed during the erosion and transport processes. This validates the commonly held assumption that 20–40 % of the eroded OC would be oxidized after erosion. Erosion-induced OC redistribution on the landscape likely represented a carbon source, although a large proportion of OC was buried. In addition, about half of the terrestrially redeposited OC (49.4 %) was buried behind dams, revealing the importance of dam trapping in sequestering the eroded OC. Although several uncertainties need to be better constrained, the obtained budgetary results provide a means of assessing the redistribution of the eroded OC within the Yellow River basin. Human activities have significantly altered its redistribution pattern over the past decades.

## 1 Introduction

As one of the most active mechanisms controlling soil formation and evolution, soil erosion affects not only the translocation of soil materials, but also the dynamics of organic carbon (OC) and nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The 2300 Gt of carbon (C) stored in global soil is 3 times the size of the atmospheric C pool and 4.1 times the biotic C pool (Lal, 2003). Soil erosion in terrestrial ecosystems is therefore capable of influencing global C redistribution among the five strongly interrelated C pools, with the other two pools being the oceanic and geologic C pools. Quantifying carbon transport within each pool or exchange between different pools is of key importance for refining the understanding of carbon cycles at different scales.

Owing to difficulties in constraining the C source/sink strength at erosional and depositional sites, the impact of soil erosion on carbon cycling has not been well documented. Prior estimates of the portion of soil organic carbon (SOC) oxidized during soil erosion and sediment transport range from 0 % to almost 100 % (Smith et al., 2001; Cole and Caraco, 2001; Lal, 2003; Van Hemelryck et al., 2011). With varying carbon oxidation rates, the global soil erosion process has been described both as a net C source of around 1 Gt yr−1 (Lal, 2003) and a net C sink of up to 1.5 Gt yr−1 (Stallard, 1998). It is clear that the fate of SOC mobilized by erosional processes remains largely unknown. Rivers represent important conduits of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems to the oceans and the atmosphere (Cole et al., 2007; Battin et al., 2009; Aufdenkampe et al., 2011). Studying river transport of the eroded OC plays a critical role in understanding carbon cycle at the watershed level.

## Location map of the Yellow River basin showing major hydrological gauge stations, reservoirs, and sediment sink zones.

Although numerous studies have attempted to analyze the Yellow River’s sediment dynamics at a sub-basin scale, systematic assessment of its basin-wide sediment budget taking into account both natural transport and anthropogenic impact is lacking. Furthermore, despite the fact that preliminary studies on the transport of OC in world rivers have been documented, Asian rivers, which alone contribute about 40% of global sediment flux, have not received sufficient attention in terms of OC transport (Schlünz and Schneider, 2000). Given such high sediment fluxes, it is expected that the OC fluxes of Asian rivers will be substantial. For the Yellow River, there is currently a great gap in knowledge regarding its sediment and OC cycles. Understanding these cycles may have global implications given its intense soil erosion and high sediment flux. Several investigations concerning OC cycling in the Yellow River show that most of the OC is transported as particulate OC, while the dissolved fraction accounts for less than 10% of the total C flux due to its high sediment load and relatively low water (Cauwet and Mackenzie, 1993; Gan et al., 1983; Zhang et al., 1992). Therefore, analyzing the redistribution of the particulate fraction after erosion could provide insights into understanding the basin-wide OC cycling.

During the period 1950–2010, mean annual water discharge at Lijin was 30.8 km³ yr⁻¹, and the mean annual sediment flux was 0.74 Gt yr⁻¹ (Ministry of Water Resources of China, 2010a). The spatial sources of water and sediment are quite different. While about 60% of the water is supplied by the upper reaches (Zhao, 1996), nearly 90% of the sediment originates from the Loess Plateau in the middle reaches (Hassan et al., 2008). As the river flows over the alluvial plains, huge amounts of sediment deposit within the channel or on the floodplains, raising the channel bed above the surrounding land at a rate of 8–10 cm yr⁻¹ (Xu, 2005; H. J. Wang et al., 2007). Around 3000 dams have been constructed in the river basin, with > 110,000 silt check dams on the Loess Plateau to intercept sediment (Ran et al., 2013c). Water diversion for irrigation has increased steadily since the 1950s.

In the 1950s, two major agricultural areas are the Hetao Plain and the North China Plain (also known as the lower Yellow River basin). About 9.55 km³ of water is annually diverted from the lower Yellow River, representing about 25% of the water discharge at Huayuankou (Qin et al., 2007; Ministry of Water Resources of China, 2010b). Considerable sediment loss has been noted with the withdrawn water (H. J. Wang et al., 2007).

On the Loess Plateau, the wind-deposited Quaternary loess is usually 130–180 m thick, up to 250 m in some localities (Liu et al., 1991). Due to its loose structure and high porosity, the loess is highly susceptible to forces of water, wind, or gravity. Coupled with heavy storms that have strong erosive power, suspended sediment concentrations exceeding 100 kg m⁻³ have been frequently recorded (Zhao, 1996). To mitigate soil erosion, soil conservation measures have been widely implemented. Apart from the silt check dams constructed on gullies, slope soil control measures have effectively protected large quantities of soils from being swept downslope (Fu et al., 2011; Ran et al., 2012). About 20 soil types have been detected on the Loess Plateau. Calcaric Regosols, grey Podzolic soils, and Calcisols are the dominant soil orders, which together cover approximately 70% of the total surface area. The SOC in the loess soils is very low, and the SOC pool has been recently increased as a result of continuous vegetation rehabilitation (Chen et al., 2007).

Obviously, ES is the sediment source, and the terms in the right-hand side of Eq. (1) are the sediment sinks. As TS, HS, WS, PS, and RS represent the sediment deposited within the landscape, and OS is delivered into the ocean, Eq. (1) can be viewed as the balance between erosion (sediment production) and the sum of the sedimentation terms. It also indicates that bulk sediments are conserved during erosion and sedimentation.

### 3. Methods

#### 3.1 Conceptual framework

Soil erosion by water at the basin scale is usually composed of three phases, including detachment, transport, and deposition of soil particles. The detachment occurs at uplands where soil is vulnerable to erosion. The eroded materials are subject to transport and deposition along their course to the ocean. In the Yellow River basin, all three phases are involved.

Equivalent to Eq. (1), a similar budget can be written for OC. Unlike the sediment transport, there is an additional flux. A considerable portion of the eroded OC is labile and is thus vulnerable to decomposition after erosion.

## Results

### 4.1 Bulk sediment budget

#### 4.1.1 Total soil erosion

Numerous attempts have been made to quantify the amount of soil erosion induced by water in the Yellow River basin over the past decades using statistical approaches or empirical models, such as the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) (Table 1). While these estimates vary by a factor of 1.5 from 1.7 Gt yr⁻¹ to 2.5 Gt yr⁻¹, most fall in the range of 2.1–2.3 Gt yr⁻¹. We adopted 1.7 Gt yr⁻¹ as the minimum erosion rate and 2.5 Gt yr⁻¹ as the maximum, with a mean of 2.2 Gt yr⁻¹ available for subsequent redistribution. It was expressed as mean ± (maximum − minimum)/2. That is, the mean erosion rate is about 2900 ± 540 t km² yr⁻¹. This indicates the basin is at a moderate erosion level, according to the latest national standards of soil erosion classification that defines the moderate level as the range of 2500–5000 t km⁻² yr⁻¹ (Ministry of Water Resources of China, 2008). In comparison, the mean erosion rate in the Yellow River basin is substantially higher than the global mean value (Reich et al., 2001), and is about tenfold that of the contiguous United States of 317 t km⁻² yr⁻¹ (Smith et al., 2001). In total, 134.2 ± 24.7 Gt of soils have been eroded during the period 1950–2010.

#### 4.1.2 Sediment deposition within dams and channels

With a total storage capacity of 72 km³ exceeding the annual water flux, flow dynamics in the Yellow River have been significantly modified by reservoirs (Ran and Lu, 2012). Furthermore, sediment trapping has altered its sediment delivery process (Fig. 3). With the commission of large reservoirs, such as the Liujiaxia Reservoir in 1969, the Longyangxia Reservoir in 1986, and the Xiaolangdi Reservoir in 2000, the sediment load decreased sharply. For instance, in the Sanmenxia Reservoir, located downstream of the Loess Plateau (Fig. 1), about 6.6 km³ of sediment, or 8.6 Gt assuming a bulk density of 1.3 t m⁻³, has been trapped.

| Mean Estimate             | 2.2                    | Derived from minimum and maximum |

### 4.2 Estimation of uncertainty

Uncertainties in the quantifiable budget terms were estimated by considering their measurement errors. Particularly, because soil erosion and SOC dynamics have changed greatly over time, their temporal variations were assessed (see Sects. 4.2 and 5.2). With the uncertainties in individual sediment budget terms, we estimated the propagated uncertainty of the hillslope redistribution by treating the errors on the individual terms as being statistically independent, although not entirely true (Smith et al., 2001). This allows us to evaluate its propagation of uncertainty by adding the uncertainties of the individual budget terms in quadrature (Taylor, 1997). Assuming the prefix δ represents independent error, we can express the uncertainty in the sediment budget as follows:

\[
\delta RS = \sqrt{(\delta E_S)^2 + (\delta T_S)^2 + (\delta H_S)^2 + (\delta W_S)^2 + (\delta O_S)^2 + (\delta P_S)^2}
\]

\[
\delta DC = \sqrt{(\delta E_C)^2 + (\delta T_C)^2 + (\delta H_C)^2 + (\delta W_C)^2 + (\delta O_C)^2 + (\delta P_C)^2 + (\delta R_C)^2}
\]

Data are from Ministry of Water Resources of China, 2010a. Sediment trapping is estimated up to the year 2005. The sedimentation rate of all inventoried reservoirs was estimated at 0.59 Gt yr−1, and in total 19.32 Gt of sediment was retained during the period 1950–2010. Particularly, most of the sediment was trapped in the large mainstem reservoirs (Table 2). Adding up the trapping contribution from the constructed silt check dams leads to a total sediment trapping of 40.3 ±1.2 Gt (Ran et al., 2013c).

In addition to sediment trapping by dams, a huge quantity of sediment would be deposited in channels or on floodplains. Three major sediment sink zones in the Yellow River basin are the Ningxia–Inner Mongolian segment, the Fenwei graben, and the lower Yellow River reaches (Xu, 2005). The stored sediment within each sediment sink zone was calculated using Eq. (2). Based on the sedimentation rates in the three major sinks (Zhao, 1996; Xu, 2005), a total of 17.8± 3.5 Gt of sediment was deposited during the period 1950–2010, amounting to a sedimentation rate of 0.29 ±0.06 Gt yr−1.

## 4.1.3 Sediment reduction by soil control measures

Soil conservation efforts have been made on hillslopes since the late 1950s. The commonly adopted measures include construction of terraces, reforestation, and grass planting. However, the soil erosion intensity did not see significant reductions until the 1970s when massive soil control practices were conducted and since then, the sediment yield has sharply decreased.

By dividing the middle Yellow River basin into four sub-catchments, Ran (2007) studied the effects of each soil control measure conducted during the period 1970–1996. The three slope measures mentioned above had collectively retained 3 ± 0.7 Gt of sediment by 1996. Starting from 1999, the Grain for Green Project that returns cropland to forest or grassland was launched on the Loess Plateau. Huge areas of cropland have been converted and as a result, the previously damaged vegetation has been greatly restored. By using the USLE model, the accumulatively controlled soils, due to vegetation recovery during the past decade, was estimated at 1.3 ± 0.4 Gt. In addition, as most adaptable hillslopes were converted into terraces before the 1990s, the total terrace area has remained largely unchanged since then. Hence, the soil erosion control rate of terraces can be assumed to be the same as before the 1990s. Accordingly, about 0.8 Gt of soil was intercepted after 1996 by terraces. Adding up the controlled soils before 1970 by slope control measures and that during the period 1997–2010, and the estimate for 1970–1996, the total reduced sediment by slope soil control measures amounted to 6.0 ± 1.1 Gt during the 61 yr.

## 4.1.4 Sediment loss through water diversion

The annual water diversion has increased steadily over the study period 1950–2010. For example, the mean annual water diversion has doubled to 27.5 km³ yr⁻¹ for the period 2000–2008 from the level of 13.8 km³ yr⁻¹ during the period 1952–1959. The excessive water diversion has caused the lower reaches near the river mouth to suffer from continuing periods of interrupted water flow since 1972. This phenomenon did not end until recently, when the central government intervened to execute a stricter water diversion quota.

As a result of water withdrawal, for the mainstem channel from Huayuankou to Lijin, the mean rate of diverted sediment increased from 0.055 Gt yr⁻¹ during the period 1950–1959 to 0.131 Gt yr⁻¹ during the period 1980–1990. It then gradually decreased to 0.056 Gt yr⁻¹ during the period 2000–2010. Overall, the diverted sediment from the Yellow River mainstem channel was estimated at 10.5 ± 0.4 Gt over the 61 yr. Approximately 6 Gt was diverted from the Huayuankou–Lijin reaches; 4.3 Gt was diverted from other areas.

## 4.1.5 Seaward sediment flux

Suspended sediment discharge into the Bohai Sea has been measured at Lijin since 1950. During the period 1950–1968, human activities were relatively limited. Except for the commission of Sanmenxia Reservoir in 1960, there was no other large-scale dam construction and implementation of soil control practices. Water diversion was also significantly reduced, as severe soil salinization in the irrigated cropland occurred after excessive flood irrigation during the period 1959–1961. As a result, the sediment flux into the ocean averaged 1.24 Gt yr⁻¹ during this period.

In the following decades, the sediment flux decreased gradually due to soil control measures, dam trapping, and enhanced water diversion. The average sediment flux during the period 1969–1986 was 0.8 Gt yr⁻¹, accounting for 64.5% of that during the period 1950–1968. After the joint operation of Longyangxia and Liujiaxia reservoirs in 1986, more sediment has been deposited within the landscape as a result of altered flow dynamics. The mean sediment flux during the period 1987–2000 declined to 0.39 Gt yr⁻¹. As of 2000, with the operation of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir, which has a storage capacity for sedimentation of 7.55 km³, the mean sediment flux has further declined to approximately 0.15 Gt yr⁻¹. Current sediment flux represents only 12.1% of that during the period 1950–1968, which is largely the result of anthropogenic impacts. The cumulative suspended sediment load into the ocean is 44.8 ± 1.9 Gt over the 61 yr.

## 4.1.6 Hillslope redistribution

Unlike other sediment pathways where sediment destination could be clearly defined, it is hard to explicitly illustrate where the locally redeposited sediments are stored. They may have been retained on hillslopes close to the eroding sites, or stored in colluvial deposits or valley bottoms. Here, all the locally redeposited sediments were referred to as hillslope redistribution for simplicity. When the aforementioned terms are defined, the redistributed hillslope sediment can be quantified from Eq. (1). A total of 10.3 ± 24.9 Gt over the 61 yr indicates an annual redistribution rate of approximately 0.17 Gt yr⁻¹.

## Soil Organic Carbon Content

| Soil Organic Carbon (%) | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| 0.5                     | Shows strong spatial variability. Due to OC input from plant residues, mainly alpine meadow, the headwater areas have a relatively higher SOC content than the loess regions. In some places on the eastern edge of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau where precipitation is 800 mm yr−1, the SOC content can reach up to 39 %. In contrast, approximately 70 % of the middle reaches show a SOC content of below 0.8 %, particularly in the regions around the desert where the SOC content is mostly < 0.5 %. |

**Figure 4.** Spatial variability of soil organic carbon in the Yellow River basin. Data are from the Environmental and Ecological Science Data Center for West China (http://westdc.westgis.ac.cn).

The basin-wide SOC content (θE) was averaged to 0.84 ± 0.12 % based on the SOC map (Fig. 4) using a sampling density of 1× 1 km². Because the light SOC fraction will be preferentially removed, the eroded soils will be enriched in SOC (Quinton et al., 2010). The enrichment ratio, defined as the ratio of the SOC content in the eroded soils to that in the parent soils, is introduced to quantify the magnitude of enrichment. It can vary from <1 to larger than 5, depending on several factors, including erosion intensity, soil particle size, and sediment concentration (Z. Wang et al., 2010).

For the Yellow River basin, owing to high erosion intensity and rapid water transport, the OC enrichment ratio is relatively low, usually less than 1.2 (Wang et al., 2008). An enrichment ratio of 1.1 was used to estimate the eroded OC from the topsoils. Furthermore, given that the sediments from gully erosion represent ∼50 % of the total (Xu, 1999; Zhao, 1996; Jing et al., 1998) and the lower SOC content of the subsoils relative to the topsoils (Wang et al., 2008; Feng et al., 2013), the enrichment ratio for half of the eroded soils from the subsoils was estimated at 0.8. The total eroded SOC was estimated at 1.07 ± 0.15 Gt during the period 1950–2010.

By analyzing sediment samples collected near the estuary, at Lijin for example, the riverine OC transport from the Yellow River can be estimated (Wang et al., 2012; Cauwet and Mackenzie, 1993). Due to the high turbidity, its dissolved OC flux is very low as mentioned earlier (Zhang et al., 1992), which is in contrast to global OC transport that is roughly equally divided between the dissolved and particulate fractions (Ludwig et al., 1998; Stallard, 1998). Compared with the global average of 2.1 % (Smith et al., 2001), the OC content of the Yellow River sediment mostly falls into the range of 0.37–0.8 % (Table 3). The seaward sediment OC content (θO) was estimated at 0.51 ± 0.28 % by calculating the average and the uncertainty range. The total transported OC into the ocean was 0.251 ± 0.138 Gt over the 61 years.

Liu and Zhang (2010) explored the spatial and temporal variations of OC in the Yellow River by sampling from the headwaters to the river mouth. For the reaches below Lanzhou (Fig. 1), they discovered that the sediment OC content remained fairly stable, in the range of 0.44–0.85 %, particularly in the water diversion reaches (Table 3).

The OC content of the diverted sediment through water diversion (θW) was assigned to be 0.51± 0.28 %. The total diverted OC was estimated at 0.054 ±0.03 Gt over the period. Likewise, the OC content for the sediment deposited in channels or on floodplains (θH) was assumed equivalent to that of the mainstem channel sediments. Because the coarse fraction with lower OC content was preferably deposited, θH was estimated at 0.49 ±0.29 % (Table 3). The total deposited OC was about 0.087 ±0.054 Gt during the period 1950–2010.

As stated earlier, soil erosion in the Yellow River basin is controlled by several heavy storms. During heavy storm events, the eroded soils can quickly reach the deposition sites after a short delivery. Except the readily decomposable labile fraction, it is likely that the eroded recalcitrant OC has little chance to be mineralized and reworked (Quinton et al., 2010). The accumulated OC trapped by these dams during the period 1950–2010 was 0.262±0.077 Gt.

**Fig. 5.** Redistribution of the eroded organic carbon in the Yellow River basin during the period 1950–2010. The line widths of the arrows are approximately proportional to the average carbon fluxes.

On the Loess Plateau, the soil materials controlled by slope was estimated at 0.75 ± 0.16 % (Table 3). With the estimated hillslope redistribution of sediment (10.3 ± 24.9 Gt), the corresponding OC redistributed was 0.077 ± 0.187 Gt.

With determined OC for each sediment budget term, the decomposed OC can be quantified. Substituting the obtained OC estimates into Eq. (5) produced a decomposition of 0.289 ± 0.294 Gt over the 61 years. Clearly, this estimate includes the propagation of uncertainty.

### 5 Discussion

#### 5.1 Summation of bulk sediment and organic carbon terms

In large river basins with heterogeneous landscapes and strong human impacts, soil erosion at uplands and seaward transport are usually not in balance. For the Yellow River basin, home to 107 million people, the extent to which the eroded materials are deposited in the river system has depended increasingly on human activity since the 1970s. Redistribution of the eroded soils and OC for the period 1950–2010 is presented in Table 4.

Given that the locally redistributed sediments are mostly stored on hillslopes or valley bottoms, the associated OC content may be similar to that of the sediment trapped by dams. However, the associated OC is more likely to be oxidized because of enhanced exposure, compared with the sediments stored in anoxic environments as behind dams. On the other hand, these locally redistributed sediments transport over a relatively short distance and would soon be covered by subsequent sediment or protected by regrown plants. Their OC content should thus be comparable to that at the eroding sites.

In this case, the average of the OC content of the two terms (θT and θE) was assumed to represent the OC content of the locally redistributed sediments. Therefore, θR was assumed to represent the OC content of the locally redistributed sediments.

## Erosion-induced massive organic carbon burial and carbon emission

The soil erosion rate is 6.01± 1.37 Tg yr−1, 1.5 times higher than the seaward erosion fluxes. Moreover, the vertical exchange (decomposition) is slightly higher than the lateral flux to the ocean. Large-scale dam construction and implementation of numerous soil conservation projects on the Loess Plateau have greatly changed soil erosion and fluvial sediment and OC fluxes (Fig. 6). Over the 61 years, approximately 63% of the eroded soils were deposited in the river system, and only 37% were discharged into the ocean. This sediment storage is significantly lower than that in the United States, where 90% of the sediment eroded off the land surface is stored somewhere in its river systems (Meade et al., 1990). In addition, human activities have directly stabilized 42.3% of the total (Fig. 6a). This higher storage relative to the seaward discharge illuminates the strong human impact on sediment redistribution on the landscape.

With respect to the OC, approximately 49.5% (0.53± 0.21 Gt) was buried in the river system and 23.5% (0.25± 0.14 Gt) was delivered into the ocean (Fig. 6b). The decomposed OC represents about 27% of the total eroded OC on average. Considering the fairly stable OC content along the mainstem channel, it indicates that the labile fraction has been largely oxidized before reaching the ocean. Thus, it can be concluded that approximately the labile fraction accounts for one-quarter of the total eroded OC, validating the commonly held assumption that about 20–40% of the displaced OC is mineralized (Davidson and Ackerman, 1993; Lal, 2003; Quinton et al., 2010; Berhe et al., 2007). Nevertheless, the obtained decomposition shows great uncertainty (Fig. 6b), suggesting the complexity in estimating the magnitude of OC decomposition. In contrast to the Yellow River characterized by low SOC (0.84%), more OC is vulnerable to decomposition for river basins with high SOC content. In addition, the human-induced OC redistribution represents a total of 34.2% of the eroded OC (Fig. 6b), which is slightly larger than the decomposed fraction. Particularly, about half of the terrestrially redeposited OC (49.4%) was buried behind dams, highlighting the importance of dams in sequestering the eroded OC. Without human activities, particularly silt check dams and slope soil control measures that are able to stabilize large amounts of sediment quickly after erosion, more OC would have been oxidized as transported en route to the ocean. Furthermore, the seaward OC flux would have been larger if no sediment was redisplaced in the river system by humans.

### 5.2 Uncertainties of the sediment budget

The soil erosion rate ranging between 1.7–2.5 Gt yr−1 with a mean of 2.2 Gt yr−1 was used to represent the basin-wide water erosion intensity over the 61 years. Because of the coupled effects of climate change and human activity, the soil erosion rate has changed significantly over time. This can be seen from the temporally decreasing sediment load (Fig. 3). Given the temporal variability and the difficulty to assess the eroded soils from stream bank collapse, they are usually excluded in the cited total erosion rates (Valentin et al., 2005). Based on the mean sediment load at Huayuankou...

5.3 Uncertainties of the organic carbon budget

5.3.1 Uncertainties from the sediment budget

Based on the erosion rate of 2.2 Gt yr−1, decomposition (0.289 Gt or 4.74 Tg yr−1) over the period represents the largest single C redistribution term (Fig. 5). Nevertheless, the total decomposed OC would have been underestimated due to the difficulty in further determining the sediment budget terms. For example, a certain proportion of the OC diverted with water would also be decomposed due to dredging and remobilization. To maintain water delivery efficiency, irrigation canals in the river basin are regularly dredged and the deposited sediments are excavated to adjacent banks. Some of the OC buried with deposited sediments is likely to be oxidized under aerobic conditions after remobilization.

Similar to the sediment budget, the magnitude of soil erosion dictates the redistribution pattern of the eroded OC. Higher soil erosion will cause higher hillslope redistribution. Because the OC content for the locally redistributed sediment is indirectly estimated from the eroding soils and dam trapping terms (Table 3), uncertainties deriving from the sediment budget would influence the OC amount of the hillslope redistribution. Furthermore, the decomposition term would significantly affect the OC redistribution results.

## Erosion-induced massive organic carbon burial and carbon emission

In terms of the seaward sediment and OC fluxes, they are based on the measurements at Lijin that is located ∼110 km upstream of the river mouth. Huge amounts of sediment would be deposited in the estuary and delta zones, and would not actually reach the Bohai Sea. The deposited OC in these zones would further be oxidized due to strong flow turbidity. Consequently, both the sediment and OC amounts that actually enter the ocean should be smaller than the determined.

### 5.3.2 Uncertainties from the organic carbon terms

Accuracy of the carbon budget is also determined by the selected OC content of the considered terms. Given the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of erosion, transport, and deposition across the basin, the budget results are with high uncertainties by nature. As the total eroded OC was estimated from the SOC map based on ground-based surveys, we adopted the value with a high confidence (Table 4). Likewise, because the OC content of the mainstem sediment has been repeatedly investigated and remained largely stable over time (Table 3), it is expected that the contents for the seaward export and sediment diversion terms are with high confidence. Because the coarse sediment is preferably deposited, the lower OC content for the sediment deposited in channels relative to the sediment that enters the ocean is with a medium-to-high confidence. For the sediment deposited in dams and controlled by soil control measures, however, the contents are proposed with a low confidence, as few data are currently available. Furthermore, given that information on the enrichment ratio for the sediments from gullies is lacking, the adopted 0.8 is possibly with a medium-to-low confidence.

Compared with SOC, the lower seaward sediment OC indicates a fraction of the eroded OC has been lost during the delivery process. From another perspective, the fairly stable sediment OC along the mainstem channel implies that decomposition is mainly confined to the initial transport stage before the OC reaches the mainstream. As the labile OC fraction is considerably vulnerable to degradation, it could be decomposed quickly following erosion. Given the long distance allowing for the labile OC to be fully mineralized before reaching the mainstream, it is easy to understand the stable but lower OC content. For the sediments trapped by dams, though the aerobic decomposition rate may be low, prevalence of anaerobic conditions would accentuate methanogenesis, leading to CH₄ evasion. Consequently, the buried OC would not be totally protected. Some of it may be mineralized instead, and the rate depends on ambient environmental conditions. Overall, the buried OC with sediments deposited behind dams or in channels may have been overestimated somewhat, which requires further studies regarding anaerobic C transformation.

If the enrichment ratio for the sediment from gully erosion is set to 0.5 and the estimates for other terms remain unchanged, closing the budget equation will lead to a negative decomposition value, indicating a C sink.

### 5.4 Implications of organic carbon emission

During the soil erosion processes, detachment of soil particles will expose SOC that is initially encapsulated within aggregates and clay domains to microbial degradation. Fine soil materials and light SOC are preferentially transported away from the eroding sites to low-lying depressional locations where they would be sequestered. As for the detachment, transport, and deposition, the first two processes are likely to increase OC oxidation. The depositional process could protect SOC from mineralization, as the SOC eroded from soil surface is buried under a thick layer of fresh sediment. However, it is arbitrary to claim that soil erosion will necessarily result in a net C source or sink.

Though the lost OC at eroding sites can be partly replenished by enhanced C stabilization, this is likely difficult to occur on the Loess Plateau as a result of its extraordinarily severe soil erosion. Investigations have shown that the Loess Plateau’s ecosystem carbon storage dynamics discovered its ecosystem had been a C source until 2000 when national vegetation restoration programs were launched. They found that the annual net ecosystem productivity was −0.011 Gt in 2000 and it had increased only in recent years. Hence, it can be concluded that the SOC replacement at uplands during the period 1950–2010 was very weak. Similarly, OC increment in the depositional lowlands resulting from ecosystem production was also limited during the period.

Although several uncertainties remain, the budget results provide a preliminary assessment of the OC redistribution after erosion. In view of the low SOC and the weak OC replacement at the eroding sites, it can be concluded that erosion-induced OC redistribution within the Yellow River basin during the period 1950–2010 likely represented a C source, emitting about 4.74 Tg yr−1 into the atmosphere, although a large proportion of OC was buried. However, given the great variability in the obtained decomposition and the inherent uncertainties in other budget terms, the erosion-induced OC cycle would be a C sink in extreme situations.

## Conclusions

A sediment budget for the Yellow River basin was constructed by considering the coupled processes of soil erosion at uplands, sediment deposition at low-lying sites and transport to the ocean. After the quantifiable terms were defined, the sediment amount redistributed on hillslopes was estimated. The obtained small hillslope redistribution corroborates the high SDR (>0.9), indicating that most of the eroded soils are transported away from the eroding sites. In addition, soil erosion and sediment transport dynamics have been greatly affected by human activities during the period 1950–2010. Approximately 63 % of the eroded soils were deposited in the river system, and only 37 % were transported into the ocean.

In combination with the spatial variability of SOC and soil erosion, the total eroded OC during the period 1950–2010 was estimated at 1.07 ±0.15 Gt. Redistribution of the eroded OC was examined in relation to the associated sediment transport and deposition processes. Approximately 49.5 % of the eroded OC (0.53 ±0.21 Gt) was buried in the river system, and 23.5 % (0.25± 0.14 Gt) was discharged into the ocean. Furthermore, half of the terrestrially redeposited OC was buried behind dams, indicating the importance of dams in sequestering the eroded OC. Closing the budget equation indicates that decomposition represents 27 % of the total eroded OC, validating the commonly held assumption that about 20–40 % of the displaced OC would be oxidized.

Despite several uncertainties to be more explicitly constrained, the budgetary results provide a means of assessing the redistribution of the eroded soils and OC within a watershed. Erosion-induced OC redistribution in the Yellow River basin during the period 1950–2010 likely represented a C source for the atmosphere. As human activities in the basin are becoming increasingly stronger, the resulting responses and related implications warrant further research to advance understanding of the erosion-induced sediment and carbon dynamics.
