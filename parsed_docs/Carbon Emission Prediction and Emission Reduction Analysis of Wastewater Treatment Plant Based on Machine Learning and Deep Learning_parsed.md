**Abstract:** Accurate accounting and prediction of carbon emissions from sewage treatment plants is the basis for exploring low-carbon sewage treatment plants and measures to reduce pollution and carbon emissions. Although carbon emission prediction models have been widely used in construction, transportation, and other fields, research in the field of wastewater treatment is still lacking, and the existing research is mostly limited to the prediction of carbon emissions from a single link or energy consumption, which makes it difficult to control the carbon emissions of the whole plant as a whole in order to realize the carbon emission reduction of the whole plant. This study proposes a hybrid prediction framework based on machine learning and deep learning, which integrates multiple algorithms and has strong adaptability and generalization ability. The pre-framework uses Pearson correlation coefficient to select feature values, constructs a combined prediction model based on the selected features using support vector machine (SVR) and artificial neural network (ANN), and optimizes the model parameters and structure using Gray Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm. The results show that the model has stronger prediction performance compared with other prediction models, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0.49% and an R² of 0.9926. In addition, this study establishes six future development scenarios based on the historical data trends and policy outlines, which provide recommendations for the development of carbon emission reduction measures for wastewater treatment plants. This study can provide a reference for exploring efficient carbon management and achieving carbon neutrality in wastewater treatment plants.

**Keywords:** wastewater treatment; carbon emission; carbon accounting; carbon emission prediction; carbon neutrality.

## 1 Introduction
The wastewater treatment sector is one of the ten highest emitters of greenhouse gases worldwide, accounting for around 2 to 3% of total carbon emissions. Moreover, its overall carbon footprint continues to rise annually. Thus, the industry must adopt carbon reduction measures to align with "dual carbon" objectives and foster synergies.

## Section 7.8: Carbon Emission Prediction Models

Between pollution mitigation and carbon abatement. While wastewater treatment significantly improves water ecosystem health by diminishing influent pollutants and achieving high-quality effluent, it also generates greenhouse gases and solid wastes, notably sludge, alongside considerable energy and resource consumption, all negatively impacting the environment. Therefore, accurate accounting and prediction of carbon emissions from wastewater treatment processes is essential to optimize pollution and decarbonization of the industry. These efforts can provide guidance on future emission trends and assist in the development of relevant energy efficiency and emission reduction strategies.

Analyzing and predicting GHG emissions from wastewater treatment plants based on accounting results can accelerate the decarbonization process of the wastewater treatment industry. Carbon emission prediction models are mainly divided into two categories: machine learning models and deep learning models. The machine learning emphasizes solving complex tasks by constructing mathematical models, while deep learning mainly simulates the composition of human neural networks and constructs hierarchical structures to automatically complete complex tasks. Both types of predictive models have been widely used in the fields of wastewater treatment and carbon emission prediction. Specific methods including regression analysis, random forests, and neural networks have been widely used in real-world scenarios such as wastewater quality prediction, carbon emission estimation, and greenhouse gas emission impact assessment.

For example, Azeez et al. developed a support vector regression (SVR) model to predict carbon emissions from automobiles, Zhu et al. investigated and predicted the peak carbon emissions from the transportation sector in China using an SVR model and a scenario analysis model; furthermore, Chu and Zhao used an enhanced PSO-SVR model to predict carbon emissions from buildings. Safa et al. employed MLR model and ANN model to anticipate on-farm wheat production, with the ANN model demonstrating superior predictive capability. Meanwhile, Vasilaki et al. developed an SVR model to forecast N₂O concentration within both the anaerobic and aeration stages. Additionally, Alali et al. conducted a comparative analysis of prediction accuracies among diverse machine learning models including ANN, SVR, KNN, etc., to estimate energy consumption in wastewater treatment.

However, model prediction performance is influenced by historical carbon emissions, demanding greater accuracy in carbon accounting models. Currently, carbon emission accounting methods for wastewater treatment systems mainly include the field monitoring method, emission factor methods, modeling methods, and life cycle assessment methods. The field monitoring method closely reflects real emissions under specific conditions, especially direct greenhouse gas emissions. Although it provides valuable insights into emission reduction at treatment plant levels, it demands substantial manpower and resources. While the modeling method can estimate overall GHG emissions using partial monitoring data, their validation is hindered by the complexity of parameters and state variables. Additionally, constant parameter updates are required to adapt to changing environmental conditions, necessitating lengthy experimentation.

## Section 7.8: Carbon Emission Accounting in Wastewater Treatment

The life cycle assessment involves greenhouse gas quantification and environmental impact assessment, albeit with a more intricate accounting process. The emission factor method is presently the most prevalent accounting approach, widely utilized at national and city scales due to its operational simplicity. X. Zhao et al. estimated methane emissions from prefectural-level municipal wastewater treatment plants in China using this method, while Dan Wang et al. compiled an emission inventory for China's enterprise-level wastewater treatment plants spanning 2006-2019. Jiahui Han et al. employed a combination of the emission factor method and mass balance method to model on-site and off-site GHG accounting for paper mill WWTPs. However, due to the lack of reliable emission factors, this method yields results with significant uncertainty. Presently, it primarily relies on emission factors provided by the IPCC. Nonetheless, research indicates that China's wastewater treatment plant emission factors are lower than those measured in European countries and by the IPCC, and variations exist in carbon emission factors among different provinces and treatment processes. Hence, employing local carbon emission factors can effectively mitigate the accounting error associated with the emission factor method.

Despite the aforementioned progress, significant shortcomings persist in both accounting for and projecting carbon emissions from wastewater treatment. The localization of emission factors poses a substantial challenge, particularly in developing countries. While carbon emission prediction models have found widespread application in various domains like construction and transportation, research in the wastewater treatment field remains limited. Existing studies predominantly focus on predicting carbon emissions from individual processes or energy consumption within wastewater treatment systems, neglecting comprehensive greenhouse gas emission predictions for entire plants. This gap hampers efforts to effectively control plant-wide carbon emissions and achieve overall emission reductions. To address this gap, this study develops a carbon accounting model using a literature review and local emission factor databases to assess carbon emissions from entire sewage treatment plants. Additionally, it utilizes treated water volume, effluent data, pharmaceutical consumption, and energy consumption as input parameters to construct a hybrid prediction model integrating machine learning and deep learning techniques for predicting carbon emissions from sewage treatment plants. Finally, the prediction model is employed for scenario analysis to devise a rational emission reduction strategy based on the prediction outcomes.

## 2.1 Carbon Emission Accounting Method

This study focuses on accounting for carbon emissions during the operation and maintenance phase of the wastewater treatment plant, drawing primarily from the IPCC National Greenhouse Gas Guidelines and relevant literature on wastewater treatment plant carbon emission accounting. The accounting boundary, illustrated in Fig. 2, encompasses direct emissions primarily from fossil sources, CH₄ emissions from anaerobic digestion, and N₂O emissions from denitrification. Only fossil carbon emissions are considered for CO₂ emissions in the biological treatment stage. Indirect emissions mainly account for carbon emissions from electricity and chemical consumption, purchased water sources, etc. Since the sludge is treated by thickening and transportation, only carbon emissions from thickening and dewatering are considered in the accounting. The main power-consuming equipment of sewage treatment plants are lifting pumps, grating machines, aeration equipment, sludge treatment equipment, etc. The chemicals are mainly flocculants, coagulants, phosphorus removers, disinfectants, and so on. The specific calculation formula is as follows:

| Primary Geogrid | Biological Treatment Tank | Secondary Sedimentation | CH₄ | Fossil | N₂O |
|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|------|--------|-----|
| Raw Sewage       | Sludge                   | Return Sludge           |      |        |     |
| Chemicals        | Storage                  | Electricity Pumps       |      |        |     |

The formula for calculating fossil carbon emissions in wastewater treatment plants is as follows:

\[
m_{CO} = Q \times MFCF \cdot \left\{ [1.1(B_{in} + B - B_{ex}) \times (1.47 - 1.42 \times (0.67))] + \frac{2}{1 + K_d \cdot SRT} \left( \frac{1.947HR_T \cdot ML_VSS \cdot K}{4.49} \right) \times \left[ (TN - TN_{in}) - (B + B_{ex} - B_{eff}) \right] \right\}

### 2.3.1 GWO Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm

Grey wolf optimization algorithm (GWO) is one of the meta-inspired optimization algorithms, which is based on the hunting behavior of grey wolves in Canidae. As shown in Fig. 5, the gray wolf pack consists of α wolves, β wolves, γ wolves, and ω wolves. α wolves dominate decision making about hunting location, sleeping time, etc., β wolves assist α wolves in decision making.

---

## 第 12 部分

The dominant position of α wolves when α wolves are in danger and unable to make decisions, γ wolves and ω wolves are located in the lowest rank of the pack. γ wolves provide services to α wolves and β wolves, while ω wolves exist as scapegoats in the pack in order to succumb to the other wolves that are dominant. The GWO optimization algorithm firstly hierarchizes the wolves into a social hierarchy and then stalks and surrounds its prey. The mathematical model of this behavior is represented as:

```
D = C ∙ 𝑋𝑝(𝑡) − 𝑋(𝑡)
𝑋(𝑡 + 1) = 𝑋𝑝(𝑡) − 𝐴 ∙ 𝐷
𝐴 = 2a ∙ 𝑟1 − 𝑎
𝐶 = 2𝑟
```

Where t is the current iteration number, 𝐴 and 𝐶 are the coefficient vectors, 𝑋𝑝 denotes the position vector of the prey, 𝑋(𝑡) denotes the current position vector of the gray wolf, and a decreases linearly from 2 to 0 throughout the iteration process. 𝑟1 and 𝑟 are random vectors between [0,1].

```
Initialize the wolf population
Calculate individual wolf population fitness
Update gray wolf specific locations
Satisfy termination conditions
Output optimal parameters
```

!Fig. 5 Top-to-bottom hierarchy of gray wolves (a) Schematic diagram of the gray wolf optimization algorithm (b)

Gray wolves have the ability to identify the location of potential prey (optimal solution), and the search process is mainly accomplished by the guidance of α wolves, β wolves, and γ wolves. However, the solution space characteristics of many problems are unknown, and the gray wolf is unable to determine the precise location of the prey.

## 2.3.2 Support Vector Machine (SVR)

SVM (Support Vector Machine) was initially used as a classification machine learning algorithm, and was later applied to regression prediction problems. While the purpose of regression is to find the function \( f(x) \) between the training input samples and the training output samples, so as to accurately predict the expected output of the test samples, SVR (Support Vector Regression) is mainly designed to solve the nonlinear regression problem, to obtain the global optimum through regression prediction, and to have a good generalization ability to unknown samples.

Different from the general regression model, the SVR algorithm is set with the acceptable maximum error \( \varepsilon \), \( w \), and \( b \) as the parameters to be determined. If the output of the prediction error value \( \varepsilon_0 > \varepsilon \), the loss is calculated. At this time, it is equivalent to constructing a prediction band with a width of \( 2\varepsilon \) centered on \( f(x) \), and if the predicted quantity falls into this prediction circle, it is considered to be predicted correctly.

---

## 第 14 部分

## Fig. 6 Schematic diagram of SVR principle

As shown in Fig. 6, \( w x + b = 0 \) is the separating hyperplane, and \( w x + b = 1 \) and \( w x + b = -1 \) are the binary labeling values, in order to ensure that \( y_i(w_{xi} + b) \) is always greater than 0. SVR mainly solves the nonlinear regression problem by mapping the nonlinearly mapped data \( x \) to the high-dimensional feature space.

Let the known training set be \( T = \{(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_l, y_l)\} \). The function obtained from SVR training regression is:

\[
f(x) = w \cdot \phi(x) + b
\]

Where \( w \) and \( b \) are the weight coefficients and constant coefficients, respectively. \( \phi(x) \) is the nonlinear mapping function in the feature space. An insensitive loss function \( \epsilon \) is introduced, where errors smaller than \( \epsilon \) will not be included in the loss function. Regularize the risk function by minimizing the following. Introduce the regularization parameter \( C \) to optimize the regression problem as:

\[
\min \frac{1}{2} || w ||^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^{l} L_\epsilon(y_i, f(x_i))
\]

Where \( C \) is the penalty factor and \( L \) is the loss function. Introducing slack variables \( \xi_i \) and \( \xi_i^* \) can express the optimization objective as:

\[
\min \frac{1}{2} || w ||^2 + C \sum_{i=1}^{l} (\xi_i + \xi_i^*)
\]

## 2.3.3 Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

The ANN model consists of three parts: input, hidden, and output layers. The Neural Network (NN) processes the input data and indicates the significance relationship between the input variables and the output mechanism. It can learn from the original dataset and test the generated network with a new dataset, further correct and strengthen the internal logical relationships for the training model, and finally validate the model with a validation dataset.

Compared with traditional prediction models, ANN has superior learning ability in multi-input data processing, and can quickly sort out the hidden internal logic of the input and output layers. This internal structure enables it to effectively manage and interpret the original time series data. Meanwhile, ANN has superior ability in mining the nonlinear features of total carbon emissions from sewage treatment plants, and this ability significantly improves the accuracy of carbon emission prediction.

## 2.3.4 Combined Prediction Model

Different prediction models have their strengths and weaknesses, and to maximize the strengths and avoid the weaknesses, a combination model is introduced. The combined prediction model integrates the prediction results of multiple models according to different weights, and the combined new model...

## Combined Modelling Framework

The calculation method of the combined model is as follows: for a given model \( j \) with input \( X_i \), the output \( Y_{ij} \) is obtained. Each model output value is assigned a weight \( \alpha_j \). The predicted value of the combined model is the combination of the output results \( Y \) and their corresponding weights \( \alpha \), represented as \( W \). This process determines the optimal weight for the model evaluation indices, resulting in the final combined model.

\[
W_i = \sum_{j=1}^{k} \alpha_j \times Y_{ij}, \quad i = 1,2, \ldots, k
\]

\[
\sum_{j=1}^{k} \alpha_j = 1
\]

\[
\text{MinRMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (W_i - y_i)^2}
\]

### 2.3.5 Model Evaluation Indicators

Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Goodness of Fit (R²) were chosen as the indicators for judging the final prediction results, and the formulas were calculated as follows:

\[
\text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - y_{\text{pre}}|
\]

\[
\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - y_{\text{pre}})^2}
\]

\[
\text{MAPE} = 100\% \cdot \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{|y_i - y_{\text{pre}}|}{y_i}
\]

## 3 Results and discussion

### 3.1 Carbon accounting for sewage treatment

Fig. 8 illustrates the total carbon emissions of the WWTP from 2012 to 2022, computed using the refined carbon accounting method and carbon emission factor data. The overall trend reveals a continuous increase in total carbon emissions over the years, with indirect carbon emissions emerging as the primary contributor to the WWTP's total carbon footprint. Particularly noteworthy is the significant contribution of carbon emissions from electricity consumption. In contrast to the conventional AAO process, the inverted AAO process reverses the anaerobic and anoxic positions. This allows the microorganisms to consume a significant quantity of the primary carbon source in the anaerobic zone. When the nitrifying solution in the aerobic zone flows back to the anoxic zone, the lack of carbon source in the traditional AAO process results in insufficient denitrification and the release of more N₂O. This results in the lowest N₂O and CH₄ emission factors of the inverted AAO process. Furthermore, the direct carbon emissions from this plant will only account for 12% of the total carbon emissions in 2022. Concurrently, the influent of this wastewater treatment plant is a mixture of domestic and industrial wastewater, which contains a high concentration of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and industrial carbon. This results in a higher proportion of N₂O and fossil carbon emissions than CH₄.

### 3.2 Analysis of influencing factors

In this study, the presence of multicollinearity among the influencing factors in relation to the available data might lead to feature redundancy or model overfitting. Therefore, the variance inflation factor (VIF) is introduced to assess multicollinearity. Table 3 indicates significant multicollinearity among most influencing factors. Such multicollinearity not only distorts regression model results but also compromises model stability. To address this issue, the Pearson correlation coefficient is employed to evaluate the correlation between parameters and extract model eigenvalues further.

The Pearson correlation coefficient, based on covariance analysis, effectively examines feature correlations without directly influencing model analysis. The correlation analysis heatmap reveals significant correlations between total carbon emissions and treated water volume, effluent COD concentration, effluent TN concentration, and various types of drug consumption. To enhance model prediction performance and efficiency while mitigating the impact of multiple covariances among features, the model prediction eigenvalues are selected as treated water volume, electricity consumption, effluent COD concentration, effluent TN concentration, and total drug consumption.

## 3.3 Model Construction and Evaluation
Normalizing the data before model construction mitigates the impact of varying data scales on model performance and enhances its accuracy and robustness. Common normalization techniques include Min-Max normalization, Z-Score normalization, decimal scaling normalization, sigmoid normalization, and Robust-Scaler normalization. In this study, Min-Max normalization was employed, with the calculation being performed in accordance with the following formula:

\[ B' = \frac{B - B_{Min}}{B_{Max} - B_{Min}} \]

Where \( B' \) is the normalized data, \( B \) is the original data, and \( B_{Min} \) is the minimum.

## 第 20 部分

To enhance the prediction accuracy of the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model, the Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm (GWO) is employed for parameter optimization, including the selection of the optimal kernel function. Through a systematic comparison of model scores across various parameter combinations, the optimal parameter configuration is determined. Notably, the linear kernel function emerges as the most effective choice, with optimal parameter values identified as C = 70816 and gamma = 48739. On the other hand, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is structured with a two-layer architecture. The first layer incorporates a hidden layer comprising 16 neurons, while the second layer features five hidden layers, each housing 32 neurons. This configuration has been selected in order to facilitate robust learning and prediction within the ANN framework.

To enhance the overall predictive accuracy of the model, a hybrid approach combining the GWO-SVR and ANN models was employed, with weights assigned to each model to optimize performance. The optimal weight ratio was determined by minimizing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), thereby leveraging the predictive strengths of both sub-models to improve overall performance. The calculated optimal weight distribution assigns a weight of 0.404 to the ANN model and 0.596 to the SVR model, achieving the highest predictive performance.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the combined model, several comparative models were introduced, and their prediction results are summarized in **Table 4**. Notably, the combined model yields a remarkable R-squared (R²) value of 0.9926, signifying a substantial improvement in prediction accuracy compared to standalone SVR and ANN models. Additionally, error metrics including RMSE, MAE, and MAPE demonstrate significant reductions, underscoring the superior performance of the combined model.

The GWO algorithm, functioning as a heuristic optimization technique, plays a pivotal role in aiding both SVR and ANN models to attain more optimal parameter configurations during training. Furthermore, compared to individual models, the combined approach exhibits enhanced robustness, mitigating the risk of overfitting to some extent.

Although Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) and Decision Tree Regression (DTR) outperform SVR and ANN models within the training dataset, their susceptibility to overfitting poses a limitation due to the constrained number of training samples. Moreover, these tree-based models are unable to simultaneously capture both linear and nonlinear relationships within the data, thus imposing constraints on their predictive capabilities.

### 3.4.1 Future rate of change settings for different indicators

The parameters defining three development scenarios (low, medium, and high speed) for the seven development indicators underwent adjustments based on historical data from the wastewater treatment plant, coupled with the "Outline of the Fourteenth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy and Society of Ningbo Municipality and the Visionary Targets for the Year 2035", alongside the "Synergetic Control of Environmental Pollution and Carbon Emissions Implementation Program".

The medium-speed development scenario mirrors the average rate of change observed over the preceding three years. Conversely, the high-speed and low-speed development scenarios were formulated and fine-tuned in alignment with the national green low-carbon policy and the objectives outlined in Ningbo's ecological planning and construction initiatives. Detailed scenario change rates are delineated in Table 5.

## 3.3.2 Scenario design

To project the carbon emissions of the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) over the next 20 years, this study established six distinct scenarios, outlined in **Table 6**. These scenarios aim to assess the carbon emissions and abatement potential of the WWTP under various developmental contexts, to evaluate the impact of different abatement strategies on total carbon emissions. By integrating considerations such as clean energy substitution, biological carbon sequestration, methane recovery for power generation, and other abatement techniques to fulfill the sustainable development objectives of WWTPs, this research offers valuable insights for other WWTPs in Ningbo. These insights aid in formulating carbon abatement measures and sustainable development strategies.

1. **Baseline Scenario**: The Baseline Scenario functions as a control group for the other scenarios. It assumes the continuation of the existing operational mode without alterations, with annual rates of change for different indicators based on reasonable extrapolations of historical data, all set to a medium level. Additionally, the projected outcomes of this scenario reflect the anticipated trend of carbon emissions from the wastewater treatment plant in the future.

2. **No Emission Reduction Measures Scenario**: The No Emission Reduction Measures Scenario functions as a control group for comparing other emission reduction scenarios. It maintains a medium level for the rate of change of treated water volume, pollutant concentration, energy consumption, and pharmaceutical consumption. Moreover, it does not include clean energy substitution, biological carbon sequestration, or methane recovery for power generation. This scenario assumes that the wastewater treatment plant retains its original treatment mode without implementing any emission reduction measures.

3. **Technological Innovation Scenario**: The scenario sets energy and pharmaceutical consumption at a low growth rate, energy substitution rate and biological carbon sequestration rate at a high growth rate, and other indicators at a medium growth rate. Through the introduction of new management policies and technological paths to reduce energy and drug consumption in the treatment process, keep the growth rate of energy and drug consumption low in order to achieve the efficient use of resources, and at the same time increase the rate of production and proportion of clean energy in the plant, adjust the energy structure of the plant, and reduce the direct carbon emissions of the plant by combining with the advanced biological carbon sequestration technology, so as to promote the simultaneous development of efficient governance and low-carbon construction.

4. **Energy Saving and Consumption Reduction Scenario**: Energy conservation and consumption reduction serve as proactive measures for source control, fostering synergies between pollution mitigation and carbon reduction. This is achieved through enhancing resource and energy conservation and efficiency, and expediting the transition towards industrial structures, production methods, and lifestyles conducive.

### 3.3.3 Scenario prediction analysis

The results depicted in Fig. 11 illustrate the scenario analysis projections. Findings indicate that under the no-abatement-measures scenario and low-development scenario, the WWTP will not achieve carbon peak before 2040. Conversely, the baseline scenario, energy-saving scenario, technological innovation scenario, and sustainable development scenario forecast carbon peak occurrences in 2039, 2036, 2035, and 2034, respectively. Their respective peaks are projected at 19,138 t, 18,073 t, 17,484 t, and 16,819 t, approximately 1.37 times that of 2022. Notably, the no abatement measures scenario and low development scenario lack sustainable development potential. Furthermore, neither the baseline scenario nor the energy saving and consumption reduction scenario can attain carbon peak by 2035. To meet the carbon peak target for water pollution prevention and control by 2030, it's...

## 3.5 Carbon Reduction Pathway Analysis

1. **Energy Conservation and Consumption Reduction**
Carbon emissions from pharmaceutical consumption and electricity consumption are the main sources of total carbon emissions from wastewater treatment plants, with pharmaceutical consumption accounting for 35.4% of the total carbon emissions from wastewater treatment plants. The total carbon emissions from pharmaceutical consumption during a half-year period can be up to 2811 tCO₂eq. Sodium acetate and other additional carbon sources can be used to reduce the dosage by means of carbon cycling and carbon recycling, thus improving the sustainability of wastewater treatment plants. Additional carbon sources, disinfectants, flocculants, and other pharmaceuticals should be purchased with priority given to those that meet sustainability criteria to reduce indirect greenhouse gas emissions, and recycling to reduce the carbon emissions associated with the pharmaceutical production process. The indirect carbon emissions from the power consumption of this wastewater treatment plant accounted for 51% of the total carbon emissions, and the average power consumption reached 0.36 kWh/m³. At present, the average power consumption of China's urban wastewater treatment plants is 0.29 kWh/m³ and the power consumption of more than 82% of the wastewater treatment plants is...

## Energy Saving in Wastewater Treatment Plants

Electricity consumption in municipal wastewater treatment plants mainly occurs in three parts: the sewage lifting system, the oxygen supply system of the secondary biochemical treatment, and the sludge treatment system. The reduction of electricity consumption can be achieved from both power saving and clean energy substitution perspectives. It has been found that electricity consumption can be reduced by 7-9% by adjusting the sludge age and dissolved oxygen concentration in water, while the use of energy-saving equipment can further reduce energy consumption. Some emerging reaction devices, such as aerated membrane bioreactors, which can significantly increase the oxygen transfer rate, and precision aeration systems can reduce the energy consumption of the aeration process. Currently, most of the electricity used is from coal-fired power generation. Increasing the use of renewable energy, such as wind power, nuclear power, and photovoltaic power, can also reduce the indirect carbon emissions of sewage treatment plants. This can be achieved by utilizing sand sedimentation tanks, secondary sedimentation tanks, and unused land in the plant to increase the proportion of photovoltaic power, thereby reducing the total carbon emissions of the whole plant.

### 2) Energy Recycling

There is a large space for energy recovery in the wastewater treatment process. The use of water source heat pumps to recover part of the secondary wastewater heat energy can reduce the energy consumption of the plant, thus reducing the total carbon emissions of the plant. The theoretical carbon emission reduction formula is as follows:

\[
m_{hp-R} = \left[M_{hp} \times |T_o - T_i| \times c \times \left(f_e \times 2.778 \times 10^{-4} - E_{Fhp}\right)\right] \times \left(1 \pm \frac{1}{COP \mp 1}\right)
\]

Where:
- \(m_{hp-R}\) is the carbon emission reduction of heat recovery, kgCO₂/kg
- \(M_{hp}\) is the mass of secondary effluent involved in heat exchange, kg
- \(T_o\) is the water source heat pump discharge temperature, °C
- \(T_i\) is the water source heat pump inlet temperature, °C
- \(c\) is the specific heat capacity of water, 4.18 kJ/(kg ∙ °C)
- \(f_e\) is the electric power emission factor, kgCO₂/kWh
- \(2.778 \times 10^{-4}\) is the conversion coefficient of kilowatt hour and kilojoule, kWh/kJ
- \(E_{Fhp}\) is the water source heat pump emission factor, kgCO₂/kJ, generally taken as \(6.208 \times 10^{-4}\)
- \(COP\) is the ratio between the heating or cooling capacity of the water source heat pump and the consumed electric power ratio.

There are four main sludge treatment technologies: mechanical dewatering, thermal drying, anaerobic digestion, and aerobic fermentation. A large amount of biogas will be produced in the process of anaerobic digestion of sludge. Upgrading the discharged biogas to bio-methane and reducing the energy consumption of the plant through biogas cogeneration can also reduce the total carbon emissions of the plant to a certain degree. The carbon emission reduction formula is as follows:

\[
m_{m-R} = M_m \times \alpha \times \left(k \times f_e - 44\right) / 16
\]

Where:
- \(m_{m-R}\) is the carbon emission reduction of biogas cogeneration, kgCO₂/m³
- \(M_m\) is the mass of biogas produced, kg
- \(\alpha\) is the conversion factor for biogas to energy
- \(k\) is the energy content of biogas, kJ/m³
- \(f_e\) is the electric power emission factor, kgCO₂/kWh

### Optimization of the Treatment Process

Efficient wastewater treatment processes can improve effluent quality and reduce carbon emissions simultaneously. For the AAO wastewater treatment process, low DO concentration promotes the production of N₂O, while high DO concentration inhibits N₂O production. Additionally, increased aeration will elevate N₂O production and vaporization. Low temperatures can reduce enzyme activity, affecting nitrification and denitrification reactions. Therefore, maintaining complete nitrification without inhibiting the complete heterotrophic denitrification process by controlling DO and temperature at reasonable levels, along with managing a certain amount of aeration, is an effective way to reduce N₂O production.

For the direct emission of the greenhouse gas methane, co-digestion techniques can be employed to increase biogas and methane production while reducing the operating costs and energy requirements of the plant.

### Enhancing Carbon Sinks

Biomass sequestration and energy recovery from biogas conversion are the two main strategies for carbon sequestration and sinks. In addition to using microalgae-bacterial microbiomes to capture carbon dioxide during the biodegradation of organic compounds to reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions, technologies such as microbial electrochemical technology (MET), photocatalytic processes, and electrochemistry can convert carbon dioxide into utilizable chemicals, such as formic acid, methanol, and methane, to enhance carbon sinks.

In conclusion, this study proposes a prediction framework that applies to carbon...

emissions from wastewater treatment plants with a high degree of prediction accuracy. The prediction framework initially located certain parameter values or coefficients provided in the IPCC and then combines them with a literature analysis to collate and update the carbon emission factors. It replaces the previous international data with the baseline emission factors for regional power grids issued by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China in different years and updates the GWP values of CH₄ and N₂O to the latest public data of IPCC 2019. Concurrently, the model incorporates fossil carbon into the accounting process, thereby resolving the issue of underestimation of the proportion of fossil carbon emissions in the traditional emission factor accounting method. Subsequently, the SVR and ANN prediction models were developed by combining covariance analysis and correlation analysis to extract features, and the GWO algorithm was used to further optimize the model parameters to improve the model's prediction performance. Finally, by minimizing the root mean square error (RMSE) and combining the two models according to the optimal weights, the coefficient of determination (R²) of the model reaches 0.9926, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) reaches 0.49%, which demonstrates superior prediction performance. This combined model effectively integrates the strengths of traditional machine learning and deep learning, capitalizing on the respective advantages of both. The introduction of nonlinear feature extraction capability, derived from deep learning, in conjunction with the generalization and interpretability of machine learning, enables the model to more accurately capture the complex nonlinear relationships between the data, thereby improving the prediction accuracy and robustness of the model.

Concurrently, this study employs scenario analysis, integrating the composite prediction model with pertinent policy frameworks to assess the carbon emissions of the wastewater treatment plant and propose targeted emission reduction strategies. Findings indicate that no emission reduction measures scenario and low development scenario lack sustainable potential, while baseline scenario and energy saving and Consumption Reduction Scenario fall short of achieving carbon neutrality by 2035. Realizing the 2030 target for carbon neutrality in water pollution prevention and control necessitates augmenting the share of clean energy substitution, methane-recycling power generation, and biological carbon sequestration rates, as outlined in the technological innovation scenario and sustainable development scenario. Moreover, robust source prevention and control measures are imperative, alongside efforts to curtail high-pollution industries, promote water-saving and low-carbon lifestyles, and prioritize the adoption of advanced, low-energy process technologies and equipment. This study lays groundwork for optimizing wastewater treatment processes towards "zero carbon" and serves as a blueprint for effective carbon management in wastewater treatment plants, facilitating the journey towards carbon neutrality.
