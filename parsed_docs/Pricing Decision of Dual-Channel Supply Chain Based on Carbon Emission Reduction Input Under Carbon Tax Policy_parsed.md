## Abstract
This paper constructs the consumer demand function based on the low carbon preference of consumers. Considering the manufacturer's carbon emission reduction investment, the pricing models of decentralized supply chain and centralized supply chain based on consumer preference are constructed. This paper also explores the effect of consumer low carbon sensitivity coefficient on wholesale prices, retail prices, demand and profits of members. The results show that the profits and carbon emission reduction level of supply chain members under centralized...
