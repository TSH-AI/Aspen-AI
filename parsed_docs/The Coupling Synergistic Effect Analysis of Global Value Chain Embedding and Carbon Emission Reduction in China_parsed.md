**Abstract**
The upgrading of global value chain and carbon emission reduction are the dual challenges faced by China's manufacturing industry. In order to achieve the goal of advancing to the middle and high end of global value chain and "dual carbon", at the same time to achieve the win-win situation of global value chain embedded and carbon emission reduction, it is of great theoretical and practical significance to play the coupling and coordination role of the two. Based on the theory of coupling coordination, this paper constructs the evaluation index system of global value chain embedded and carbon emission reduction system, and analyzes the development status of global value chain embedded and carbon emission reduction in 21 sub-sector industries from 2005 to 2014. The results show that most industries are in the moderate coordination stage, and the lag of global value chain is the key factor restricting their coordinated development. Labor-intensive industries have the best coupling coordination degree, forming a situation of mutual promotion of development, followed by technology-intensive industries and labor-intensive industries. Therefore, improving the level of green technology, breaking through the technological blockade and improving the position of Chinese industries in the global value chain are conducive to forming a positive interaction between the two.

## Introduction
As the world’s largest manufacturing country, China is also an active participant in the global value chain and a promoter of green development. “Accelerating green development and participating in the reform of the global economic governance system” has an important and far-reaching significance to promoting sustainable and healthy development of economic and social development. However, due to the excessive dependence on imported intermediate inputs and the weak absorption capacity of local enterprises and other factors, the “low-end locking” problem of China’s manufacturing industry in the global value chain division system is prominent, coupled with the two obvious characteristics of “high energy consumption, high pollution”, manufacturing transformation and upgrading situation is grim. Although existing studies have recognized the connection between the division of global value chain and carbon emission, they have not yet made an introduction and analysis from the perspective of collaborative development. Facing the dual pressure of manufacturing value chain upgrading and “dual carbon” goal realization, it is necessary...

## Literature Review

The concept of value chain was first proposed by Porter in his book *Competitive Advantage* [1]. Later, rich achievements have been made on the dynamic mechanism, mode, trajectory, and governance model of global value chain upgrading (Gereffi [2]; Humphrey & Schmitz [3]; Sturgeon & Lee [4]). Feenstra & Hanson [5] more precisely define the key concepts in global value chains. Since 2011, China’s Ministry of Commerce has led the organization of a systematic study on the accounting of trade added value and related issues. Scholars have extensively studied China’s traditional industries such as clothing industry and light industry as well as high-tech industries such as general aviation manufacturing industry, electronics industry, and equipment manufacturing industry, and reached a consensus that China’s manufacturing industry as a whole is at the low end of the global value chain. Part of contract manufacturing is gradually moving towards self-owned brand production, but problems such as “high-end reflux,” “low-end diversion,” and “poverty growth” are prominent [6].

## Construction of Coupling Coordination Degree Model

### Standardization of Index

The range standardization method is adopted to standardize the original data and eliminate the influence of data size, dimension, and content-crossing direction. Assuming that the number of objects to be evaluated is m, and the number of evaluation indexes is n in the evaluation system, among them i= 1,2... m; j= 1,2... , n.

### Analysis of the Coupling Coordination Degree Between Global Value Chain and Carbon Emission Reduction

Coupling refers to the interaction of two (or more) systems through various influences.

#### Positive Index
\[ y_{ij} = \frac{(x_{ij} - \min x_j)}{(\max x_j - \min x_j)} \]  (1)

#### Negative Index
\[ y_{ij} = \frac{(\max x_j - x_{ij})}{(\max x_j - \min x_j)} \]  (2)

Where, \(\max x_j\) and \(\min x_j\) represent the maximum and minimum values of indexes respectively.

#### Calculation of Index Entropy
\[ H_j = -\frac{1}{\ln m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} p_{ij} \ln p_{ij} \quad (1 \leq j \leq n) \]  (3)

Where, \(H_j\) is the entropy of indicator \(j\), \(p_{ij} = \frac{x_{ij}}{\sum_{i=1}^{m} x_{ij}}\), and \(m\) represents the number of industries, \(0 \leq p_{ij} \leq 1\).

#### Determination of Index Weights
\[ w_j = 1 - \frac{H_j}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} (1 - H_j)} \]  (4)

Where \(w_j\) satisfies two conditions: \(0 \leq w_j \leq 1\).

### Calculate the Integrated Index of Global Value Chain and Carbon Emission Reduction
According to the previously calculated standardized data \(y_{ij}\) and the index weight calculated by entropy weight method \(w_j\), the multi-objective linear weighting method is adopted to calculate the environmental composite index of global value chain embedding and carbon emission reduction:

\[ E_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_j y_{ij} \]  (5)

\[ GVC_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n} w_j y_{ij} \]  (6)

Where \(E_j\) and \(GVC_i\) are between 0 and 1. The larger the \(E_i\) is, the better the carbon emission reduction results of industry \(i\).

### Construction of Evaluation Index System
This paper draws on the existing literature and builds the global value chain system and carbon emission reduction system following the principles of systematic, scientific, and data availability. As shown in **Table 1**, the main data are from UIBE GVC database, and the data on carbon dioxide emissions by industry are from the carbon emission data supplemented by WIOD in 2019. In this paper, we selected the 56 industries panel data of China from 2005 to 2014 as samples, and classified and merged the industries into 21 sub-sectors, in order to conduct an empirical study on the coupling coordination relationship between global value chain embedded and carbon emission reduction.

## Comprehensive Index Analysis of Global Value Chain Embedded and Carbon Emission Reduction

Figure 1 shows the average composite index of global value chain embedded and carbon emission reduction for 21 industries from 2005 to 2014. It can be seen from the GVC composite index that the GVC composite index of electronic communication equipment manufacturing is higher compared with other industries, while the GVC composite index of food and tobacco, pharmaceutical manufacturing and construction is lower. This indicates that the electronic communication equipment manufacturing industry has a high degree of GVC embedded, large export added value and strong value-added ability, while the food and tobacco industry, pharmaceutical manufacturing industry and construction industry have low participation and value-added ability in GVC.

As can be seen from the comprehensive carbon emission reduction index, all industries maintain a relatively high level, indicating that the overall carbon emission reduction results of the country are good. However, power, gas and water production and supply industries, electronic communication equipment manufacturing carbon emission reduction comprehensive index is relatively low. The reason may be that firepower power generation is still the most main source of power in China, and China is a major manufacturer of electronic components, leading to the result that the carbon emission and the trade implied carbon emission of these two industries are both large, and composite index of carbon emission reduction are both low.

According to the weight determined by the entropy method and the calculation method of the coupling coordination degree, the coupling coordination of the three factor intensive industries from 2005 to 2014 was calculated. At the same time, the three industries with intensive factors were averaged over the years (as shown in Table 5), and the coupling coordination of carbon emission reduction and global value chain embedded was compared and analyzed. The 21 sub-sectors are divided into:
1. Labor-intensive industries: agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery, food and tobacco, textile industry, wood processing.
2. Capital-intensive industries: mining industry, non-metallic mineral products, other manufactured products and waste materials, machinery and equipment manufacturing, electrical equipment manufacturing, petroleum coking industry, electricity, gas and water production and supply industry, metal smelting industry.
3. Technology-intensive industries: chemical raw material manufacturing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, electronic communication equipment manufacturing, transportation equipment, other industries.

## Section 7.8: Coupling Coordination Degree Analysis

### 7.8.1 Labor Intensive Industry
- The labor-intensive industry shows a consistent high level of coupling with moderate coordination from 2005 to 2014.
- The coupling degree fluctuates slightly but remains above 0.82, indicating stable integration with the global value chain.

### 7.8.2 Capital Intensive Industry
- The capital-intensive industry also maintains a high level of coupling, with values consistently above 0.91.
- This suggests a strong alignment with global value chain processes, particularly in sectors like mining and manufacturing.

### 7.8.3 Technology Intensive Industry
- The technology-intensive sector exhibits a similar trend, with coupling degrees reflecting robust integration into the global market.
- The analysis indicates that as technology advances, the coupling coordination degree improves, enhancing overall efficiency in carbon emission reduction efforts.

**TABLE 5: Coupling coordination analysis under the density of factors in different industries.**

According to the results in Table 5, it can be seen that the coupling coordination degree of global value chain embedded and carbon emission reduction after averaging treatment shows the following characteristics: labor-intensive and technology-intensive industries are weaker than capital-intensive industries. From 2005 to 2014, the coupling degree of the three kinds of intensive industries showed a slow rising trend, among which the labor-intensive industry showed a zigzag change track of first rising and then falling, but generally belonging to the high-level coupling stage. Capital-intensive and technology-intensive industries grew steadily. In the past 20 years, three kinds of intensive industries have developed rapidly, but the labor-intensive industries showed the fastest growth, while the capital-intensive industries showed the slowest growth, and technology-intensive industries were in the middle.

**Conclusions and Countermeasures**

**Main Conclusions**

There is a close interaction between global value chain embedded and carbon emission reduction. It is of great theoretical and practical significance to realize the coordination of the two between global value chain embedded and carbon emission reduction in the process of realizing the goal of “double carbon” and moving towards the middle and high end of global value chain. Based on the theory of coupling coordination, this paper establishes the evaluation index system of global value chain embedded system and carbon emission reduction system, calculates the comprehensive index of global value chain and carbon emission reduction by using the linear weighting method, and analyzes the development status of 21 subdivided industries under the intensity of different industries from 2005 to 2014, and draws the following conclusions:

First, due to the importance of the realization of the “two-carbon” goal and the industry’s move to the high end, the main theme of their development will inevitably cause damage to the ecological environment. Therefore, we need to focus on green development while moving up the global value chain.

**Countermeasures and Suggestions**

Based on the above conclusions, the following countermeasures and suggestions are put forward: First, we need to focus on green development while moving up the global value chain. In the process of development of developing countries, development before governance is the main theme of their development, which will inevitably cause damage to the ecological environment.
