## Abstract

In this paper, the direct carbon emission calculation method is used to analyze the hidden carbon emissions of each sector of China's trade with the EU. In this paper, the SDA analysis method is used to calculate the proportion of four factors affecting the embodied carbon emissions. Among them, the contribution rate of the improvement of energy use efficiency to the total embodied carbon reduction is 12.8%. Its technological innovation was only 6.7%. It shows that China still has a lot of room for improvement in technological innovation.

## Section 7.8: Detailed Analysis of Carbon Emissions

### 7.8.1 Factors Influencing Carbon Emissions

| Factor                | Description                                      | Impact on Emissions |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Trade Volume         | The amount of goods traded between regions       | High                |
| Transportation Mode  | The method of transporting goods (e.g., air, sea)| Medium              |
| Energy Source        | Type of energy used in production and transport  | High                |
| Policy Regulations    | Government policies affecting trade and emissions | Variable            |

### 7.8.2 Comparative Analysis

| Region               | CO₂ Emissions (tons) | CH₄ Emissions (tons) | N₂O Emissions (tons) |
|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Region A             | 1000                 | 50                    | 10                    |
| Region B             | 1500                 | 70                    | 15                    |
| Region C             | 1200                 | 60                    | 12                    |

### 7.8.3 Summary of Findings

- The analysis indicates that trade volume has a significant impact on carbon emissions.
- Transportation mode plays a crucial role, with air transport being the most carbon-intensive.
- Regions with stricter policy regulations tend to have lower emissions.

## Conclusion

The study highlights the importance of understanding the factors influencing carbon emissions in international trade. By addressing these factors, it is possible to reduce the overall carbon footprint associated with trade activities.
