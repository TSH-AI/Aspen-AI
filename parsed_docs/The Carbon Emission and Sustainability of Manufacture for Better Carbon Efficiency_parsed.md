# The Carbon Emission and Sustainability of Manufacture for Better Carbon Efficiency
**Hsuan-Yu, Pan**

## Abstract
Taiwan is an export-focused manufacturing economy instead of a brand-marketing one. In other words, the manufacturing exporters in Taiwan are generally adopting supply chain management measures to secure orders. The upcoming implementation of the European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) has caused carbon anxiety in Taiwanese manufacturers before it has been enforced. The emphasis on environmental conservation is a sign of progress; however, amid significant social change, businesses often feel pressure rather than seeing it as a positive development. Although the total amount of resources is still increasing, businesses have not yet fully adapted to the new society and businesses will tend to become agitated and anxious, even frantic. Unfortunately, this problem cannot be resolved in the short term. The businesses can only focus on developing and adopting to meet the market. To maintain Taiwan’s position in the global supply chain, it’s essential to adapt and comply with the new international regulations. The first step is voluntary carbon disclosure to address carbon challenges. The purpose of this research is to investigate Taiwanese manufacturers’ understanding of how voluntary disclosure aids corporate decision-making.

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Impact of Greenhouse Gases

In recent years, global climate change issues have garnered substantial attention. With greenhouse gas emissions being one of the primary causes, Taiwanese businesses need to address the carbon challenge and risk. It is essential for companies to fully comprehend the importance and value of greenhouse gas’s negative impacts and take actions to control greenhouse emissions aiming for sustainable development.

Greenhouse gases are the gases in the atmosphere of the Earth that can absorb and re‑emit radiation from the surface of the Earth, such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), etc. These gases cause the average temperature of the Earth to rise and lead to global climate change and extreme climate. The primary greenhouse gas emissions are from human activities such as the production of energy, transportation, industrial manufacturing, etc.

Greenhouse emissions have caused severe damage to the environment and the future growth of economics. For instance, hurricanes, floods, and droughts pose significant threats to agriculture, fisheries, water resources, and ecosystems, and even endanger human activities. Greenhouse gas emissions also have negative impacts on future growth of the economics, such as rising the cost of energy, resource waste, and damage to corporate image. Furthermore, public concern about greenhouse gases is increasing and more relevant laws have begun to be gradually formulated. Therefore, corporations are facing increasing pressure to control greenhouse gas emissions.

## 1.2 Motivation and Purpose

As global climate change issues become increasingly severe, carbon reduction has emerged as a crucial topic worldwide. As key participants in economic activities, businesses play a significant role in carbon reduction efforts. Taiwan, being an export‑oriented economy with small and medium‑sized enterprises (SMEs) forming a crucial part of its economic structure, must confront international carbon reduction trends and requirements directly.

First, SMEs should conduct greenhouse gas inventories to understand the carbon emissions. Companies can utilize relevant greenhouse gas emission calculation methods and tools, such as carbon footprint assessment tools and carbon emission accounting standards, to measure greenhouse gas emissions. This allows businesses to understand the emission levels and sources, identify potential opportunities for carbon reduction, and set specific goals and measures for reducing carbon emissions.

Second, energy management and audits are also essential for SMEs to understand the carbon reduction needs. Companies can engage in energy management and audits by monitoring and recording energy usage, analyzing energy consumption, and conducting energy audits to identify and quantify energy consumption, as well as pinpoint areas with higher energy usage. By understanding the energy usage, companies can develop corresponding energy‑saving and carbon reduction plans.

In summary, understanding the carbon reduction needs of Taiwanese SMEs requires...

## 1.3 Research Limitations

The issue of greenhouse gases is a relatively nascent topic in Taiwan, with familiarity limited to a small number of key personnel and practitioners. Consequently, conducting large-scale surveys is not feasible. Therefore, this study employs the expert interview method for its investigation.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Enterprise External Environment

The ISO 14064-1:2018 standard serves as a guideline for the quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals at both the planning and organizational levels. It emphasizes the requirements for defining the boundaries of GHG emissions and removals, the quantification of these emissions and removals within organizational operations, and the identification of specific corporate actions aimed at improving GHG management (ISO, 2018).

In addition to the original specifications of the ISO 14064-1:2006 standard, the 2018 update incorporates the concept of a full life cycle, thereby broadening the scope of greenhouse gas management across the corporate value chain. This approach allows companies to manage GHGs from a supply chain value perspective, adopting a full life cycle viewpoint. By aligning with various management system standards' audit objectives, companies can establish a comprehensive sustainable development framework, helping the organization to achieve sustainability goals. Furthermore, the GHG inventory results from ISO 14064-1:2018 are closely aligned with other widely recognized international environmental standards, thus alleviating the regulatory burden on enterprises (Guan-Lin Lu & Yuh-Ming Lee, 2020).

### 2.2 Enterprise Internal Environment

Internalizing carbon costs involves incorporating the expenses associated with carbon emissions into the internal cost structures of companies or individuals, thereby holding them accountable for the negative impacts of the emissions. The advantage of this approach lies in its ability to incentivize companies and individuals to reduce carbon emissions, enhance carbon efficiency, and drive low-carbon development by increasing the financial burden associated with emissions.

For businesses, the process of internalizing carbon costs requires addressing two key aspects. The first involves the monitoring and calculation of carbon emissions; companies must accurately assess the emission levels to determine the corresponding costs to bear. The second aspect pertains to the internal accounting.

## 2.3 Enterprise Internal Processes Management

Carbon taxes and carbon credits not only impact a company’s profitability but also influence its product portfolio. As carbon pricing becomes a global trend, companies must proactively consider reducing the total carbon emissions throughout the production process rather than passively observing how taxes erode overall profits.

The establishment, maintenance, and continuous improvement of internal management systems are essential to ensuring that organizations follow a systematic approach to achieving ongoing performance enhancement. This approach represents a pragmatic method for improving carbon efficiency, which is intrinsically linked to human behavior. The efficiency of carbon usage hinges on how energy is utilized and the awareness and choices made by individuals regarding energy consumption. For instance, as awareness of energy conservation and the adoption of renewable energy sources grows, people are likely to choose more environmentally friendly and efficient means of energy consumption, thereby improving carbon efficiency.

Moreover, carbon efficiency is closely related to lifestyle and consumption habits. High-carbon activities, such as frequent driving, meat consumption, and extensive travel, contribute to reduced carbon efficiency. In contrast, adopting low-carbon lifestyles, such as walking, cycling, and following a vegetarian diet, can significantly reduce carbon emissions and enhance carbon efficiency.

5. Conclusion and Suggestions

Manufacturing industries experiencing carbon anxiety must focus on enhancing carbon efficiency to effectively address these challenges. But what exactly is carbon efficiency?

"Carbon efficiency" is a practical concept that refers to the efficiency with which energy is utilized in the production processes of an enterprise. During energy use, whether it involves fossil fuels or electricity, greenhouse gas emissions are inevitably generated. Therefore, improving energy utilization efficiency becomes a crucial strategy for effectively reducing these emissions. Moving forward, carbon efficiency is likely to be recognized as a key indicator in the effort to reduce carbon emissions, as it enables companies or organizations to lower their carbon footprint while simultaneously boosting production efficiency and optimizing resource utilization.

In this context, carbon efficiency should be viewed as a method or means to achieve the broader goal of net-zero carbon emissions. By enhancing carbon efficiency throughout both production and consumption processes, companies can reduce carbon emissions, thereby advancing closer to the net-zero carbon goal.
