## Abstract

The need for adequate and consistent policies to mitigate the continuous rise of carbon emission have motivated the energy economist in the past decades to actively involved and explore common economic agents that are driving the rising pattern in the environmental pollution. This study is positioned towards contributing to the on-going debates on this issue by exploring the impact of bank credit to the private sector on aggregate carbon emissions and carbon emission intensity in Nigeria over the period 1971–2016 using dynamic ARDL simulations. Controlling for the influence of fossil energy intensity of consumption and economic globalization, the study found that bank credit to the private sector has a positive significant long-run increasing effect on aggregate CO₂ emission and carbon emission intensity in the economy. Second, the estimated coefficients show that fossil energy intensity of consumption and economic globalization have a significant long-run and short-run increasing impact on aggregate CO₂ emission and carbon emission intensity in the economy. In contrast, the population has a significant long-run and short-run reducing effect on aggregate CO₂ emission and only the long run reducing effect on carbon emission intensity. Third, economic growth has significant short-run and increasing long-run effects on aggregate CO₂ emission and a long run increasing effect on carbon emission intensity. In sum, the results show that the economy is yet to transient to renewable energy.

## Introduction

The collaboration of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) affirmed carbon emission as the cause of global warming and climate change in the world (IPCC 2018) and warned that if no drastic action is taken to reduce carbon emissions, the physical impact on climate change on the international economy will be significant. The extractions of natural resources in Africa are mostly carried out with the use of heavy machinery that turns out enormous carbon emission (Kwakwa et al., 2018). The broad use of heavy machinery in the industrial sector coupled with the expansion of existing firms and the springing up of new business activities are inimical to the environment quality with challenges of spontaneous rise in carbon emission (Letcher 2020 and Lahiani 2020).

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) 2020, Nigeria had estimated 37bn barrels of untapped crude oil reserves at the end of 2019, which contains 15% of Africa’s oil reserves and 16% of its gas. Appendix 1 reveals the total energy usage in Nigeria; this trend showed Biofuels and waste are major sources of energy in Nigeria, which account for about 80% of total primary energy consumed in Nigeria (Ben-Iwo, Manovic and Longhurst, 2016). IEA (2020) data showed that greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel production used have increased by 16% since 2015.

Fossil fuel combustion has been the major means of energy generation in the Nigerian economy and has translated into heavy carbon emission. The potential effect of this on climate change is a threat to Nigerian sustainable economic development, accounting for a projected damage of 6% to 30% of gross domestic product by 2050. This will translate to the loss of US$ 100 to US$ 460 billion if drastic measures are not taken to cushion the effect (Amin et al 2020). Records show a 2.7% per annum increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions released after three years of the landmark Paris Agreement (Le Quéré et al. 2018). The rise in income of households and production activities stimulates economic growth with an intensive demand for heavy technologies and investment in energy-intensive sectors (Shoaib et al. 2020; Gill et al. 2019; Liu and Song (2020); Lahiani, 2020). In other words, financial development has the tendency to raise the significant level of carbon emissions either from emerging economies or developing countries (Jiang, Yang and Ma 2019).

Fig. 1 shows the level of financial sector development in selected African countries. It can be seen that Nigeria has a relative development in the financial sector from the year 2006 upward, while domestic credit to the private sector as a percentage of GDP averaged 13.03% between 2001 and 2017. In line with the trend, financial development expands production capacity and social development with significant pressure mounting on the environment (Aye and Edoja, 2017; Danish and Wang, 2019; WWF, 2018). The rising trend of financial development in Nigeria is associated with the steady growth of carbon emissions as shown in Fig. 2, the causes yet to be given adequate attention for policymakers. A deepened financial system with more access to credit by households increases income and expansion of firms’ production growth. The disbursement of credit to enhance domestic product supply and create demand for local and international markets depends on the functioning financial market caused by asymmetric macroeconomic variables (Shahbaz, Shahzad, Ahmad, and Alam, 2016). Credit facilities to industrialists pave the way for entrepreneurs to acquire more industrial machines with a rise in the intensity of carbon emissions (Xing, Jiang, and Ma, 2017). The promotion of consistent burning of fossil fuels by sectors (oil, gas, and coal) leads to untamed carbon dioxide (CO₂) releasing into the atmosphere, thereby wreaking havoc on environmental quality (Johnsson et al., 2019).

Financial development through the financial markets equally enables firms to have access to financial assistance to acquire low carbon emission technologies (Tsaurai, 2019). Financial development plays a pivotal role in allocating financial resources to adopt environmentally friendly technology by sectors of the economy as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a low pace of economic growth (Hao et al., 2016). In view of this, the initiative of development finance under the Central Bank of Nigeria engages in policy formulation and implementation towards new product discovery and creating an enabling atmosphere for financial institutions to deliver services.

## Carbon Emission and Financial Development in Nigeria

The knowledge gap linking carbon emission and carbon emission intensity to financial development in Nigeria motivates the research paper. The depth of financial intermediation in promoting green financing to prevent environmental damage attracted global research interest.

### Figure 2: Carbon Emission: Nigeria Ecological Footprint by Land Type
!Carbon Emission: Nigeria Ecological Footprint by Land Type

The financial sector development increases the carbon emission intensity in Nigeria. Figure 2 shows the rise in carbon emission from the year 2001 at its peak. Studies on carbon emission intensity and financial development are still scarce in the existing literature in the Nigerian context. The earlier study by Aminu et al. (2020) adopted the Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag technique that failed to capture sufficient STIRPAT dynamic features. Also, Omoke et al. (2020) used a nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) framework to analyze the ecological footprint in Nigeria with no measures of population, affluence, and technology for adequate projection policy formulation. Studies such as Adejumo and Asongu (2020), Adejumo (2020), Ali et al. (2019), Ali et al. (2016), Rafindadi (2016), and Riti and Shu (2016) used carbon emissions (CO₂) to measure degradation in Nigeria. The rise in financial sector development along with the carbon emission increase calls for urgent attention for environmental sustainability. The components of carbon and non-carbon emissions degradation in the environment formed an all-inclusive measure for a sustainable environment (Wang and Dong, 2019; Danish and Wang, 2019). The country-specific insights findings will facilitate and strengthen policy decisions given empirical modeling based on the Stochastic Impact by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) framework that incorporates carbon emission.

## Theoretical Literature

This section is divided into two: theoretical review and empirical review. The empirical review is encapsulated in two forms: the discussion area and the tabular form as shown in Table 1 below. This subject area is currently submerged with empirical entries from different studies adopting a global perspective, regional perspective, and national perspective. The seminal work of Kraft & Kraft (1978) is credited to be the first empirical entry as they attempted to establish the link between energy consumption, economic growth, and carbon emissions. They concluded that economic growth is associated with substantial energy consumption that induces carbon emissions. Recently, attention has been shifted from economic growth to other variables like financial development.

The channel through which financial development impacts carbon emissions differs from developing economies to developed economies. In developing economies, in pursuance of economic growth and prosperity, financial system institutions play a sacrosanct role by extending the distribution of funds to investible channels which may not be environmentally friendly, ranging from manufacturing firms vis-à-vis its high pollution potential emanating from consistent reliance on traditional energy sources and cheap access to credit to business owners and households enabling them to purchase equipment with energy demand. Financial development in the developing economies’ case, through the growth channel, increases the level of energy consumption especially from traditional sources, which in turn, increases carbon emissions in developing economies (Sardosky, 2010; Sardosky, 2011; Chang, 2015; Sethi et al., 2020; Samreen & Majeed, 2020). On the other hand, in the case of developed economies, financial development reduces carbon emissions, firstly through the presence of admirable institutional quality, presence of socially responsible and sophisticated financial instruments.

## Section 7.8: Financial Development and Carbon Emissions

Investors and the machinery of bank financial institutions and the stock market collectively engender investment in green-oriented manufacturing firms with renewable energy-efficient technologies associated with little or no negative environmental effects as opposed to the fossil fuels used in less-developed and developing economies. Another school of thought hinged the low CO₂ emissions in developed economies on the transfer of heavy production plants from developed countries to developing countries where there is a loophole in regulation either tax-based or environment-based by way of foreign direct investment.

Examining the carbon intensity-financial development nexus, there are two notable channels through which financial development can affect carbon emissions intensity other than the economic growth and development channel. The second channel will definitely differ from developing economies to developed economies; financial development can assist developing countries in reducing carbon emissions intensity through supporting the adoption of low-carbon energy technologies by way of copy-manufacture from developed economies. However, in developed economies, financial development reduces carbon emissions intensity by actively funding research and development activities to decipher numerous low-carbon technologies to support existing technologies. The third channel relies on the discretion of financial institutions and their level of social responsibility reflected in their provision of sophisticated financial assistance and services to green-oriented firms at lower costs.

Other streams of literature established positive linkage between environmental degradation indicators and financial development. For instance, the work of Shahzad et al. (2017) employed the Autoregressive Distributive Lag model on time series data covering the period of 1971–2011 to investigate the association among carbon emission, bank credit, and energy use in Pakistan. Their results revealed a direct association between credit to the private sector and carbon dioxide emission and between trade openness and CO₂. Further findings indicated a non-linear association between the variables. In like manner, Zhang and Zhao (2019) employed GMM in an STIRPAT framework on data ranging from 1996-2015 to examine the linkage between social development and environmental pollution in 30 provinces of China and found that R&D...

Investment exerted positive influence on CO₂. It was also revealed that a two-way causal-effect existed between financial development index and CO₂. Also, analyzing the influence of GDP per capita, energy use, foreign investment, and bank credit to private sectors on environmental quality in Kuwait with data spanning 1980 - 2013, Salahuddin et al, 2018 adopted ARDL bound test and observed that FDI, per capita GDP, financial development and electricity use exerted direct and significant impact on CO₂ emission in the country. A case study of eight Asian nations employed FMOLS technique on data covering the period of 1982 to 2017 to analyze the effect of energy use and domestic credit to private sector on CO₂ emission and found that bank credit, fossil fuel, and urbanization have direct linkage with CO₂ emissions while trade openness reduces CO₂ in the nations under study (Abbasi, et al, 2020). A similar study was carried out by Tahir et al, 2020 in South Asian countries with same econometric approach on longitudinal data covering the period of 1990 - 2014 and the result showed that domestic credit (as financial development indicator), energy use, and GDP have positive impact on carbon emission. It was also revealed that globalization reduces CO₂ in the region.

The effect of energy mix and financial development on environmental degradation was explored by Ali et al (2019) in Nigeria. Utilizing ARDL approach on time series data spanning 1971 to 2010, they found that at both long and short run periods, credit to private sector exerted direct and significant influence on CO₂ emission. It was equally found that GDP and energy use have direct linkage with CO₂ in the long run but exhibit inverse association with CO₂ in the short period. Yasin et al. (2020) exploring the association among domestic credit to private sector, political institution, energy use and environmental degradation in a pool of 59 less developed nations with data covering 1996 to 2016, adopted GMM and EGLS techniques and found that CPS, urbanization and electricity use have direct influence on CO₂ in lower-income nations. The study further validates the EKC hypothesis. A similar study was also conducted by Yasin, Ahmad, and Chaudhary, 2020, who proxied environmental quality with ecological footprint and grouping 110 nations into high-income and low-income countries, using same GMM model on data spanning 1996 to 2016, they found that financial development and energy use increase ecological footprint in high-income nations while urban population, trade openness and political institution have inverse influence on ecological footprint. Pooling 17 emerging nations to explore the effect of disaggregated bank development indices on ecological footprint with data ranging from 1991 – 2013, Destek, 2019, adopted panel regression approach and the findings showed that bank credit.

## Section 7.8: Financial Development and Environmental Impact

The relationship between financial development and environmental impact has been a subject of extensive research. Various studies have explored how different aspects of financial development influence ecological footprints and carbon emissions.

### 7.8.1: Overview of Financial Development and Pollution

Research indicates that financial development can mitigate pollution. For instance, a study by Omoke et al. (2020) utilized a non-linear ARDL technique on data from 1971 to 2014 in Nigeria. They found that an increase in financial development inversely influences the ecological footprint, while a decrease escalates it. Additionally, factors such as GDP, energy use, urban population, and globalization positively contribute to the ecological footprint in Nigeria.

### 7.8.2: Banking Credit and Carbon Emissions

Another strand of literature confirms that the relationship between banking credit and carbon dioxide emissions is indirect. Zaidi et al. (2019) examined the connectivity among globalization, domestic credit to the private sector, and carbon emissions for APEC nations. Using the Westerlund cointegration technique on data from 1990 to 2016, they found an inverse association between domestic credit and CO₂ emissions. Their findings also indicated that globalization reduces CO₂ emissions while confirming the presence of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis in APEC nations.

In Pakistan, a study on the linkages among domestic credit, energy use, economic growth, and carbon emissions utilized simulated ARDL on data covering the period of 1982-2018. The study found that while financial development, foreign direct investment, real GDP, and energy use raise CO₂ emissions, domestic credit reduces it (Khan, Teng, and Khan, 2020).

### 7.8.3: Case Studies in China and Brazil

In China, Guo and Hu (2020) employed the same technique on data spanning 1997 to 2016 and established an inverse association between stock returns and CO₂ emissions. This suggests that financial development indirectly influences environmental degradation indicators, indicating that China successfully allocates credits or financial facilities to support environmentally friendly projects. Such projects lead to investments in cost-efficient energy technologies, such as business vehicles and real estate term loans, which are more aligned with low-carbon finance.

Nwani and Omoke (2020) employed STIRPAT within the ARDL framework to examine the association between bank credit and low-carbon emissions in Brazil, using data from 1971 to 2014. Their findings revealed that credit to the private sector promotes low-carbon emissions, as an inverse linkage existed between them. Similarly, Tian et al. (2017) analyzed the impact of domestic credit to the private sector on CO₂ intensity in China, using data from 1992 to 2014. Their results showed a cointegrating relationship between the variables, with both innovation and domestic credit having an inverse influence on carbon intensity. They also noted a poor correlation between stock returns and carbon emission/GDP intensity.

The third strand of literature found mixed results on the association between carbon dioxide emission and financial developments. To start with, Ibrahim, 2018 explored the linkage between foreign trade, domestic credit and CO₂ emission intensity in middle-income nations with data ranging from 1991–2010. Employing the EKC framework, their findings showed that financial development reduces carbon emission intensity in upper middle-income nations and Europe while exacerbates pollution in Europe. A case study of Chinese provinces on the linkage between bank credit and carbon dioxide utilized panel cointegrating techniques (FMOLS, DOLS and PVECM) on data covering the period of 2001-2015 and observed that financial development exerted direct influence on CO₂ in some provinces and inverse impact on CO₂ in other provinces (Zhao and Yang, 2020). Considering the effect bank credit to private sector on environmental quality in G and N-countries, Zafar et al, 2019, employed cointegration method and established that financial development indicator reduces CO₂ in G-7 nations while it raises CO₂ in N-11 nations. The study validates the EKC hypothesis. The findings also showed a two-way causality existing between financial development index and carbon dioxide emission. A study in Chinese provinces and national economy, employed spatial panel models on data ranging from 2007 to 2016 and found that financial development at provincial level and population raises carbon intensity while at national level, the linkage was inverse (Liu and Song, 2020). Shahbaz et al, 2020 employed an EKC on ARDL framework to explore the environmental effect of economic growth, financial development and research and development expenses for the UK with data spanning 1970 - 2017. Their findings validated the EKC hypothesis.

The fourth strand of literature proved that there was no linkage between domestic credit to private sector and environmental degradation based on the level of significance. For instance, Lu, 2018 analyzed the influence of electricity use and bank credit on carbon emissions in 12 Asian developing nations with longitudinal data spanning 1993–2013. Adopting panel cointegration technique, the study found that the bank credit had no significant effect on environmental quality while GDP and energy use exerted direct influence on CO₂ emission. In the same manner, Chen et al, 2019 adopted DSUR method on data spanning 1980 to 2016 in the examination of the influence of domestic credit, energy sources on carbon dioxide emission in Central Eastern European nations and found no significant linkage between credit to private sector and carbon dioxide emission. However, they established that globalization and both energy sources increased CO₂.

| Zhao et al         | 2014 | Reusing wastes can reduce environmental damage from iron-ore production.                    |

Another strand of literature reinforces that activities of construction firms, manufacturing firms, and raw materials suppliers for construction can contribute to an increase in carbon emissions other than financial development as widely discussed in academic literature. CO₂ emissions generate more impact on the environment and one of the main polluting industries is that of cement and its components. Aside from financial development, population, urbanization, and industrialization also contribute to an increase in carbon emissions in developing economies already substantiated with vast empirical evidence. But more differently, construction and manufacturing activities also contribute greatly to environmental degradation apart from financial development if mismanaged and by-products are not immersed as raw material in creating other common construction materials.

Elaborating further on the environmental impacts of cement production and other building components; Azevedo et al (2019) confirmed that the application of locally manufactured ceramic materials for civil construction contributes to environmental degradation as wastes are discarded directly into the host environment. In a similar vein, the processing of ornamental stones in Brazil increases environmental pollution as each operational stage of ornamental stone processing generates a considerable amount of sludge wastes which, if not channeled into the reproduction of another finished good, will constitute environmental nuisance. A more practical example of recycling wastes into more acceptable and environmentally friendly finished goods is seen in the experiment carried out by Carvalho et al (2014); where sludge waste generated from the cutting process of granite and limestone were dried and crushed in a media alongside a type CPII 32 cement to produce soil-cement blocks.

The heavy reliance on traditional fossil fuels for production and the poor handling of raw material sources (disposing and extracting) sums up the negative effects of cement production and its various alternatives on its host environment. Further fears of environmental pollution are heightened in the case of increasing iron-ore production owing to mass storage of by-products (tailings) in dams which most times ruptures and amounts to leakages to its host environment; a feasible solution still resides in reusing the wastes to produce materials for constructive purposes to reduce environmental damage.

## Model and methodology

The IPAT model was suggested by Ehrlich and Holdren (1971) as a paradigm, whereby economic activities affect greenhouse emissions and thus lead to environmental pollution. A basic environmental effect equation is therefore in the form:

\[ I = PAT \] (1)

I mean environmental effects, P means population, A means affluence, and T represents technology. Therefore, the IPAT model describes the impact of human activities on the environment as a function of income/affluence, population, and technology (York et al. 2003). Therefore, the IPAT model explains the environmental effect of human activities on the environment as a function of income, population, and technology (York et al. 2003). In line with IPAT projections, Dietz and Rosa (1994) have suggested the stochastic impact on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) by regression to help the statistical test conditions. The model STIRPAT is represented as:

\[ I = aP^bA^cT^d\epsilon \] (2)

The above model identifies a, b, c and d as scales exponents of P, A, and T respectively. ε is the white noise and the is shown in log-form below using the standard STIRPAT model is given as:

\[ \ln I = \ln a + b(\ln P) + c(\ln A) + d(\ln T) + \epsilon \] (3)

In the aforementioned, b, c and d describe the predicted environmental impact innovation in the selected explanatory variable by 1 percent change, if the remaining other determinant factors remain unchanged. Using technology (T) in Equation 3, other variables' effect could be captured in STIRPAT model (see, Dietz and Rosa 1994). Several new studies have expanded the STIRPAT model to explore other factors' effect (Huang and Zhao, 2018; Zhang and Zhao, 2019; Nwani and Omoke, 2020). The STIRPAT model is expanded to include the effects on the private sector of domestic credit by banks in line with the intent of this study. The STIRPAT extended model takes shape:

\[ \ln I = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1(\ln P) + \alpha_2(\ln A) + \alpha_3(\ln Fossil) + \alpha_3(\ln P_{crsg}) + \alpha_3(\ln E_{cge}) + \epsilon \] (4)

Where,

\[ \ln I \] represents the environmental impact of carbon dioxide emissions. This study employs two variables such as: aggregate carbon dioxide emissions (CO₂) and carbon emission per unit of gross.

## Section 7.8: Environmental Challenges from Financial Activities

The domestic product (lnCEI) extends the understanding of the level of environmental challenges from the activities of the financial system. These variables can either be measured as metric tons per capita denoted by CO₂, or as carbon emission per unit of gross domestic product denoted by Carbon emission intensity (CEI).

- \( \ln P \) is the population
- \( \ln A \) is economic growth
- \( \ln F_{\text{ossil}} \) is fossil energy consumption GDP per capita
- \( \ln P_{\text{crsg}} \) is the financial development
- \( \ln E_{\text{cge}} \) is the globalization index
- \( \epsilon \) is the stochastic error term.

All the variables are sourced from World Bank Indicators from the period of 1972 to 2016.

Financial development is one of the major explanatory variables measured by the domestic credit to the private sector as a percentage of GDP. Bank credits to business firms can lead to an increase in production and technological progress via the purchase of heavy machines, which in turn emits carbon into the environment, causing degradation of the atmosphere. Alternatively, credits to the private sector will enable business expansion, which will lead to economic growth and then to air pollution from machines.

However, it has been posited that credit to the private sector influences carbon emissions through business effects, consumer behavior, and technological influence.

Gross domestic product is used to proxy affluence. It represents the economic growth calculated as real GDP per capita, that is, at constant 2000 US dollars. Rising economic growth due to economic activities leads to high energy demand and demand for energy-consuming goods, which in turn leads to environmental pollution as a result of carbon emissions. Economic growth brings about an increase in energy consumption, which leads to carbon dioxide emissions.

Population is measured as the total number of people living in an area over a specified time period. It is one of our major independent variables. Theoretically, there have been two perspectives in the literature on the linkage between population and carbon dioxide emissions:

1. Ecological theory of modernization, which posits a positive relationship between modernization or population and CO₂ emissions.
2. The urbanization transition theory, which predicts that population has a significant impact on carbon emissions.

### The ARDL-bounds cointegration test

The long run association among the variables in equation 4 is investigated using the autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) known as bound testing. The technique is the most favored approach of literature co-integration considering its econometrics advantages such as; it offers robust and reliable estimates in both small and large samples, ii) it is the most acceptable technique as long as none of the variables is integration of order I(2). (iii) It offers tools for the derivation of short and long-term model estimates when cointégration among variables is verified (Pesaran et al. 2001). The empirical formula of the ARDL model is based on the log-linear specification in Equation 4 and it is provided in Equations (5) and (6) for carbon dioxide (CO₂) and carbon intensity (CEI) aggregates, respectively.

\[
\Delta \ln CO₂_t = a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{p} a_1^i \Delta \ln CO₂_{t-1} + \sum_{i=1}^{p} a_2^i \Delta \ln P_{2t-1} + \sum_{i=1}^{p} a_3^i \Delta \ln A_{3t-1} + \sum_{i=1}^{p} a_4^i \Delta \ln Fossil_{4t-1}
\]

\[
+ \sum_{i=1}^{p} a_5^i \Delta \ln P_{csrg5t-1} + \sum_{i=1}^{p} a_6^i \Delta \ln E_{cge6t-1} + a_7 \ln CO₂_{t-1} + a_8 \ln P_{t-1} + a_9 \ln A_{t-1}
\]

\[
+ a_{10} \ln Fossil_{t-1} + a_{11} \ln P_{csrg t-1} + a_{12} \ln E_{cge t-1} + a_D \ln TB_{rk t-1} + \epsilon_t \tag{5}
\]

### Equations

The following equations represent the model used in the analysis:

1. **Equation (6)**:
\[
\Delta \ln C E I_t = b_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} b_1^i \Delta \ln C E I_{t-1} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} b_2^i \Delta \ln P_2_{t-1} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} b_3^i \Delta \ln A_3_{t-1} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} b_4^i \Delta \ln F_{ossil4_{t-1}}
\]
\[
+ \sum_{i=1}^{n} b_5^i \Delta \ln P_{csrg5_{t-1}} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} b_6^i \Delta \ln E_{cge6_{t-1}} + b_7 \ln CO_2_{t-1} + b_8 \ln P_{t-1} + b_9 \ln A_{t-1}
\]
\[
+ b_{10} \ln F_{ossil_{t-1}} + b_{11} \ln P_{csrg_{t-1}} + b_{12} \ln E_{cge_{t-1}} + b_{D} \ln T_{Brk_{t-1}} + \epsilon_t
\]

2. **Regression Analysis**:
Regression on equations (5) & (6) produces F and T statistics that are used for testing the null hypothesis of no cointegration among the variables:
\[
H_0: a_7 = a_8 = a_9 = a_{10} = a_{11} = a_{12} = 0; \quad H_0: b_7 = b_8 = b_9 = b_{10} = b_{11} = b_{12} = 0
\]
The effect of structural breaks (TBrk) is represented as \( a_D \) and \( b_D \) in Equations (5) & (6) respectively. Using the most recent and reliable critical values for F and T statistics as proposed by Kripfganz and Schneider (2019), and the corresponding approximated p values to evaluate the already stated null hypothesis. Cointegration decision is made by comparing approximate F and T statistics to upper and lower critical values; thus, if the probability value is less than 0.10 in the F and T statistical, the null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected.

3. **Error Correction Model**:
The error correction model is captured in Equations (7) and (8) respectively, identifying the short-run dynamics in the association among the variables.

**Equation (7)**:
\[
\Delta \ln CO_2_t = a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_1^i \Delta \ln CO_2_{t-1} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_2^i \Delta \ln P_2_{t-1} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_3^i \Delta \ln A_3_{t-1} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_4^i \Delta \ln F_{ossil4_{t-1}} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_5^i \Delta \ln P_{csrg5_{t-1}} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_6^i \Delta \ln E_{cge6_{t-1}} + \lambda_2 e_{cm_{t-1}} + \epsilon_t
\]

**Equation (8)**:
\[
\Delta \ln C E I_t = a_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_1^i \Delta \ln C E I_{t-1} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_2^i \Delta \ln P_2_{t-1} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_3^i \Delta \ln A_3_{t-1} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_4^i \Delta \ln F_{ossil4_{t-1}} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_5^i \Delta \ln P_{csrg5_{t-1}} + \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_6^i \Delta \ln E_{cge6_{t-1}} + \lambda_1 e_{cm_{t-1}} + \epsilon_t
\]

!Figure 3: Econometric steps in the application of Dynamic ARDL Simulation

The novel dynamic ARDL Simulation was introduced by Jordan and Philips (2018) and credited for solving the traditional ARDL model's problems in examining the long-run and short-run model specifications. According to Sarkodie and Owusu (2020), the dynamic simulated ARDL model can stimulate, estimate, and automatically plot to predict graphs of negative and positive changes in the variables and their short and long-run relationships robotically. The application of this model follows some econometric protocol, as shown in Figure 3.

First, the ARDL bounds testing procedure used in the novel dynamic ARDL simulations requires a strict first-difference stationary, I(1) dependent variable (Jordan and Philips 2018). This implies that the dependent variable must be non-stationary at the level I(0) to apply cointegration.

Second, bounds testing procedure with a dependent variable violating the initial conditions can be tested using the standard but modified ARDL bounds test with surface regression (Kripfganz and Schneider 2019). Several unit root tests can be employed to test this conditional requirement, such as augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), Phillips-Perron (PP), among others.

Third, all sampled independent variables can either be I(0) or integrated of order one, I(1) but not greater than I(1) devoid of a structural break, autocorrelation, and heteroskedasticity.

Using the dynamic ARDL error correction term algorithm for Equation (9) and (10), 5,000 simulations are performed from a multivariate normal distribution. Two specific criteria must be met before implementation to ensure accurate and reliable simulation estimates. Based on these criteria, it considers the following preliminary steps. First, unit-root analysis measures the order integration among the variables to ensure that none of the variables has a unit root. Second, a Pesaran et al. (2001)-based ARDL-bound test is implemented to determine whether cointegration among variables exists. Confirmation of co-integration is a requirement for the implementation of dynamic simulations of the mentioned ARDL models.

### Analysis
Figure 4 shows the time evolution of the selected variables from 1971 to 2016, while Figure 5 shows the partial correlation between the key variables of interest and the financial development in Nigeria.

Plot A shows a strong positive correlation exists between affluence (lnA) and emissions (lnCO₂). Plot B shows that the partial correlation between carbon emission intensity ln(CEI) and fossil fuel consumption is positive. Plot C follows a negative correlation between lnA and lnFossil.

In summary, Plots A and B indicate that the energy consumption trend and economic structure in Nigeria could lead to carbon-intensive activities. Considering the negative correlation between the amount of CO₂ emitted per unit of output ln(CEI) and the domestic credit to the private sector by banks, it is therefore subject to investigation whether there is any significant relationship leading to energy transition between bank credit to the private sector and carbon emissions in the Nigerian economy.

In table 3, to obtain the stationarity states of the variables of our model, we performed the traditional unit root test of Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF), and the Lee and Strazicich (2003) Lagrange multiplier (LM). The ADF test examines the time series properties without accounting for structural changes in the series but the second test does. Thus, both tests reveal mixed stationarity. That is, ADF test indicates that lnCEI (log of carbon emission intensity), lnCO2 (log of carbon dioxide emission), 𝑙𝑛Pcrsg (log of private sector credit), 𝑙𝑛Fossil (log of fossil energy) and 𝑙𝑛Ecge (log of economic globalization) were found to be first difference stationary, which implies the presence of unit root in the data while lnP (log of total population) and lnA (log of GDP per capita) have no unit root and as such they are stationary at level. On the other hand, in table 4, the Lee and Strazicich (2003) Lagrange multiplier (LM) test shows that lnCEI, lnCO2, lnP and lnEcge are all stationary at level while lnA, lnPcrsg and lnFossil are only stationary when differenced at first difference.

## ARDL-bounds test for cointegration

Table 5 shows the implementation of ARDL bounds test for cointegration that explores the long-run relationship among environmental indicators (𝑙𝑛CO₂, 𝑙𝑛CEI), and the following explanatory variables: population (𝑙𝑛P), affluence (𝑙𝑛A), fossil energy intensity of consumption (lnFossil), domestic credit to the private sector (𝑙𝑛Fcrsg), and economic globalization (𝑙𝑛Ecge). Kripfganz and Schneider (2019) provide P value, critical values, and the computed F and T statistics at the lower side of table 5. The optimum lags are based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the presence of dummy variable is evidence of structural break in the system. The results show that calculated F and T have a significance level and are more than upper critical values I(1) at 1% level for both specifications, while the P values are below 0.001 (p < 0.001). On the basis of these figures, in both specifications suggesting co-integrating environmental indicators (CO₂, CEI), population (P), income (A), fossil energy intensity (fossil), domestic credit to the private sector (Pcrsg), and economic globalization (Ecge) in Nigeria, the null of no co-integration hypothesis between the variables was denied. The two models from the ARDL do not have any econometric misspecifications, serial correlations, heteroscedasticity, non-normality, when subjected to various kinds of diagnostic tests such as; Breush-Godfrey LM, Breusch-Pagan Godfrey, ARCH, Ramsey RESET, and Jarque-Bera (see table 5). Figure 6 and 7 are used to test the long run structural stability test using the CUSUM and CUSUMSQ test statistics as prescribed by Brown et al. (1975) and there is evidence of stability over the selected period in the two specifications.

## Dynamic ARDL Simulation Results

For comparative analysis, we started by applying the traditional ARDL analysis and then followed by the dynamic ARDL model simulations. The empirical evidence in **Table 6** & **Table 7** confirm the presence of a common relationship in terms of positive or negative signs between the endogenous and exogenous variables; however, their measurements vary. To provide robust estimates, a multivariable normal distribution vector is provided by 5000 simulations. **Table 6** & **Table 7** show the model estimates of aggregate carbon dioxide (CO₂) emission and carbon emission intensity (CEI) respectively. The dynamic ARDL simulations observed at 10 time points with positive or negative 10 percent innovations on each of the exogenous variables in the model reflect graphical representation in figures 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 to cause counterfactual changes in the independent variables.

In **Table 6**, we found that bank credit to the private sector (𝑙𝑛Pcrsg) is positively linked to carbon emissions in the long run at the 10% level. This implies that (𝑙𝑛Pcrsg) plays a significant role in increasing carbon emissions. All else being equal, a 1% increase in bank credit to the private sector leads to carbon emissions by 0.2391%. However, in the short run, bank credit to the private sector (𝑙𝑛Pcrsg) is statistically insignificant. Figure 8 indicates the impact of a positive or negative 10% change in predicted 𝑙𝑛Pcrsg on 𝑙𝑛CO₂. A positive 10% change in the first graph produced an insignificant influence on 𝑙𝑛CO₂ in the short run; however, the influence shows a significant increase in the predicted long-run value. In the second graph, a negative 10% change produced an insignificant rise in 𝑙𝑛CO₂ in the short run. The long-run influence has a significant increase in the predicted value, but the influence in the long run decreased. Thus, the positive change is high compared to the effect of the negative change in 𝑙𝑛CO₂.

Similarly, in **Table 7**, bank credit to the private sector (lnPcrsg) increases carbon intensity in the long run. All else equal, 0.27% of carbon intensity is led by a 1% increase in bank credit to the private sector. However, bank credit to the private sector (lnPcrsg) is statistically insignificant in the short run. Figure 9 indicates the influence of a positive or negative 10% change in predicted 𝑙𝑛Pcrsg on 𝑙𝑛CEI. In the first graph, a positive 10% change produced an insignificant influence on carbon intensity in the short run; however, the impact shows a significant increase in the predicted long-run value. Conversely, the second graph shows that a negative 10% change produced an insignificant increase in carbon intensity in the short run. In the long run, the value had a significant increase.

The empirical results for long-run impact of population, economic growth, fossil consumption power intensity and economic globalization are reported in Table 6. The impact of population on carbon emissions (lnCO₂) is negative and significant. This shows that population is declining carbon emissions. It implies that population is associated with higher income levels which serve as a determinant factor in demanding a friendly ecosystem that reduces carbon emission. Keeping other factors constant, a 1% increase in lnP lowers carbon emissions by 1.5% in the short-run and 0.75% in the long-run. Economic growth (affluence) is positively linked to carbon emissions (lnCO₂) at 1 percent level. It implies that a 1% increase in economic growth may lead carbon emissions to increase by 2.0801 percent in the short-run and 0.9504 percent in the long-run keeping all else the same.

We found evidence of an inverted U-shaped relationship between carbon emission and economic growth by comparing the short-run and long-run economic growth; the long-run effect of economic growth is found to be smaller than the short-run impact. This result is consistent with Narayan and Narayan (2010), who predicted the EKC hypothesis through the same procedure. Figure 10 explains the effect of 10 positive and negative shocks on aggregate CO₂ emissions (lnCO₂) in expected economic growth value (lnA). The first graph shows that positive 10% shocks created a substantial short-run increase in aggregate CO₂ emissions, and the effect stayed unchanged in the long-run. A negative 10% innovation is linked to a positive effect in short-run aggregate CO₂ emissions, and the influence in long-run value produced a significant increase in the expected value. Even, long-term impact decreased.

In Table 6, fossil energy intensity of consumption increases aggregate CO₂ emissions significantly at 1% level of significance. A 0.9226% and 0.4375% of aggregate CO₂ emissions is increased due to a 1% rise in fossil energy intensity of consumption in the short-run and long-run leading to...

In Table 7, shows the short-run and long-run positive effect of \( \ln \text{fossil} \) on carbon emission intensity at 1% level. It implies that a 1% increase in \( \ln \text{fossil} \) may lead carbon emission intensity by 1.048% in the short-run and by 0.4751% in the long-run keeping all else unchanged.

Figure 12 reveals the positive and negative shocks in \( \ln \text{fossil} \) resulting in changes in carbon emission intensity (lnCEI). In the first plot, the positive shock of \( \ln \text{fossil} \) is stable in the long run, even though it increases carbon emission intensity in the short term, while the second plot produced a significant positive impact on carbon emission intensity in the short-run. The effect also had a significant predicted long-run value.

Figure 13 indicates the positive and negative changes in economic globalization and its impact on Nigeria's CO2 emissions. A 10% positive change in economic globalization suggests a positive effect on the CO2 emissions in Nigeria both in the short run and in the long run. This could be attributed to the rising trade and investment activities, leading to a higher amount of energy usage required in the production and consumption activities, which eventually release more carbon dioxide into the environment. Meanwhile, a 10% negative change in economic globalization indicates a positive effect on CO2 emissions in the short run. In the long run, CO2 emissions decrease with a decrease in economic globalization. Overall, the estimates from this empirical study regarding the impact of economic growth and fossil energy consumption align with the theoretical expectations and existing empirical findings. Past empirical entries such as Letcher (2020) believed that the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is as a result of increased activities from economic growth and fossil energy consumption. For instance, a long-run decrease in the CO2 emissions could be from a decrease in the economic globalization.

The deviation from the short run equilibrium is corrected through the negative and statistical significance of the coefficient of ecm (−1) in both specifications. In Table 6, the coefficient −0.4391 indicates that approximately 43.91% of short-run deviation converges to a long run stable state.

## Conclusion and Policy Implication

The world has undergone a significant increase in carbon dioxide emissions, which harm the living conditions for households. This tremendous concern for environmental pollution has led academics and environmental policymakers to focus on this issue to find suitable solutions and implement convenient policies. In this study, we contribute to the existing literature on the link between financial development and CO₂ emissions. This study drew insight from the case of Nigeria by exploring the impact of bank credit to the private sector on carbon emission over the period of 1971 to 2016. The model incorporated the impact of fossil energy intensity of consumption, bank credit to the private sector, and economic globalization in the Stochastic Impact Regress on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) Framework. In the analysis, the ARDL test confirmed the long-run equilibrium of these parameters over the sampled period in Nigeria.

Using the dynamic ARDL model simulations, the results found are as follows: First, the implication of the positive association between financial development and carbon dioxide in Nigeria can be attributed to the fact that the availability of financial facilities stimulates the expansion of economic activities, which brings about high demand for energy consumption goods that cause carbon dioxide emission in turn. This finding supports the assertion by Al-Mulali, Saboori, and Ozturk (2015), who observed that bank credits make possible loan facilities which encourage high demand for luxury goods and energy consumption goods and as such lead to air pollution by means of CO₂ emission.

Also, this should guide policymakers to make policies that are environmentally friendly by advising the financial sectors to pursue giving loans to low-carbon projects and investments. Financial stability is a long-term goal, and that is why it is not significant in the short period. The direct relationship between GDP per capita and environmental degradation could be linked to the assertion that a rise in GDP entails a rise in national income, and when this happens in a nation, the country will be in danger of high pollution, especially when there is a lack of energy conservation policy. This implies that Nigeria still uses obsolete equipment and relies heavily on non-renewable energy sources, which causes greenhouse gas emissions, thereby degrading the environment. In order to produce and at the same time maintain environmental quality, the government should encourage...

manufacturing industries by subsidizing the use of energy efficient equipment in production.

Energy intensity having positive influence on CO₂ implies that Nigeria relies heavily on non-renewable energy sources such as coal and other energy sources which emits greenhouse gasses because of its emerging economy nature. It is due to infant industries in the country using obsolete and poor energy consumption technology that hampers the environment. Government can achieve tackle this problem by making subsidies available on low carbon technologies to encourage the use of renewable energy technology and at the same time impose high tax on fossil fuel consumption in Nigeria beyond a certain threshold. This relationship is necessitated as developing economies like Nigeria will find it very hard to stop energy use since it is the key input for production of goods and services such as services industries, home utilities whose actions emit carbon into the environment. This outcome corroborates the findings of Haseeb et al. (2018) for BRICS, Shahbaz et al. (2018) for Japan. Thus government should strive for the enhancement of energy efficiency via advanced and energy-efficient technologies. Positive linkage between globalization and CO₂ emission indicates that Nigeria has not been able to attract high technological investment from abroad which provides access to advanced energy-efficient technologies which will help reduce carbon emission.
