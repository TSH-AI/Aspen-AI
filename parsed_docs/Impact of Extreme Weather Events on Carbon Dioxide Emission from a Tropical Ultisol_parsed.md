## Abstract
The impact of extreme weather events were studied in Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, Abia State. The objective of the study was to ascertain the impacts of short drought and long drought on organic carbon content and CO₂ emission. Soil samples were randomly collected at 3 sampling points at 0 – 15 and 15 – 30 cm depth and subjected to induced weather condition of short drought/heavy rainfall and long drought/low rainfall. Analysis of variance was used to compare the influence of weather events on the measured soil properties at different depths and significant means were separated using least significant differences at 5% level of probability. Line graph was used to represent the impact of extreme weather event on the emission of CO₂. Results showed that emitted carbon dioxide, organic carbon, total nitrogen and C:N varied with the induced weather events at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 8 weeks. Higher organic carbon, total nitrogen and C:N were recorded under short drought/heavy rainfall (2 and 4 weeks). The volume of carbon dioxide emitted was lower in long drought/low rainfall (310 cm³ – 345 cm³) than in short drought/heavy rainfall (45 cm³ – 97 cm³) with the quality of organic matter, and the extent to which these organic substrates are protected from microbial attack by adsorption to clay surfaces and inclusion in micro-aggregates playing an important role in suppressing carbon dioxide production.

## Introduction
Extreme weather conditions have large effects on water cycling and availability thereby increasing intensification of both rainfall and drought. Rewetting of soils after drought and especially the first rain event after a drought can have a large effect on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Large influxes of CO₂ are induced during rewetting of dry soils.

## Impact of Extreme Weather Events on Carbon Dioxide Emission from a Tropical Ultisol

### Abstract
There was a strong overall increase in CO₂ emissions within the tropical rainforest belt. The climate is typically hot humid tropical with a mean annual rainfall from about 3000mm along the coast to 2000mm in the hinterlands. Weather conditions drive the carbon balance of soils by controlling the uptake and release of CO₂. Longer dry periods in between heavier precipitation events alter the stability of large carbon pools in the soil ecosystem. Soils have a great potential for carbon sequestration and storage as extreme weather conditions show decomposition in the soil and carbon accumulates over a long time. Globally, there is more carbon stored in the soil than in the atmosphere and plant biomass. According to Adhikari et al., the stability of the large pool of carbon is uncertain due to human influence and changes in climate. Rainfall, as an extremely important factor in carbon cycling, directly affects productivity, decomposition rates, methane (CH₄) production and oxidation, CaCO₃ precipitation, and carbon dioxide sequestration. Soil ecosystems have large carbon pools; under certain conditions, they can become a source of carbon to the atmosphere. Soils also become a source of carbon when low redox potentials initiate other greenhouse gas production, such as CH₄ and N₂O. The ratio of CH₄ emissions to net CO₂ uptake is an index for an ecosystem’s carbon exchange balance with the atmosphere. The carbon exchange balance in the soil depends on the interactions between physical conditions, microbial processes in the soil, and vegetation characteristics. Through heterotrophic respiration and decomposition of organic matter, CO₂ is released from soil, increasing exponentially with higher temperatures and decreasing with soil saturation.

### Introduction
Although tropical soils contribute to the annual global emissions of CH₄, due to changes in extreme weather conditions, the carbon exchange balance of tropical soils is uncertain. Therefore, there is a need to study the impact of extreme weather events on CO₂ emission from a tropical ultisol. The objective of the study was to ascertain the impacts of short drought and heavy rainfall on organic carbon, total nitrogen, and CO₂ emission.

### Materials and Methods

#### Study Area
The study was conducted in Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, Abia State. The study area lies between latitudes 5°27′ N and 5°29′ N and longitudes 7°25′ E and 7°35′ E (GPS).

#### Soil Sampling and Experiment
Auger soil samples were collected randomly at 3 sampling points at the depth of 0 – 15 cm and 15 – 30 cm in three replications, totaling eighteen samples. The soil samples were saturated and subjected to extreme weather conditions of short drought/heavy rainfall (2 and 4 weeks after saturation) and long drought/low rainfall (6 and 8 weeks after saturation). After saturation, the samples were taken to the laboratory for analyses using standard laboratory procedures.

### Laboratory Analysis
- **Total Nitrogen**: Total Nitrogen was done by the Kjeidahl digestion and distillation method as described by Udo et al.
- **Organic Carbon**: Organic carbon was measured by the dichromate wet oxidation method of Walkley and Black.
- **Determination of Carbon Dioxide**: 10 ml of 1N NaOH solution was placed in a container which is connected to another container with 250 g of soil.

## Organic Carbon, Total Nitrogen and C:N of Soils Studied

The organic carbon, total nitrogen and C:N of the soils studied are shown in Table 1. At both depths of 0 – 15 and 15 – 30 cm, the soil under short drought/heavy rainfall at 2 weeks after saturation was observed to have the highest organic carbon at both depths with values 1.930 and 1.900 %, respectively. The soil under long drought/low rainfall at 8 weeks after saturation was observed to have the lowest organic carbon at both depths with values 1.260 and 1.240 %. Under total nitrogen, 2 weeks of short drought/heavy rainfall recorded the highest at both depths with values 0.161 and 0.158 %, 8 weeks of long drought/low rainfall was observed to have the lowest total nitrogen (0.116 and 0.113%) at both depths. With regards to C:N at both depths, short drought/heavy rainfall at 2 weeks after saturation had the highest C:N value ranging from 11.988 to 12.025, while 8 weeks of long drought/low rainfall after saturation was observed to have the lowest C:N values ranging from 10.862 to 10.973.

## Impact of Extreme Weather Events on CO₂ Emission

The highest volume of carbon dioxide (345 and 310 cm³) evolved at 2 weeks of short drought/heavy rainfall after saturation followed by 4 weeks. The lowest volume of CO₂ (45 and 97 cm³) evolved at 8 weeks of long drought/low rainfall followed by 6 weeks. Generally, the volume of CO₂ evolved decreased with depth. These observations reflected the influence of organic carbon on the evolved CO₂.

| Weather Condition (Wks) | 2 wks | 4 wks | 6 wks | 8 wks |
|-------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Carbon Dioxide (cm³)    | 400   | 350   | 300   | 250   |
|                         | 200   | 150   | 100   | 50    |

The variation in emission of CO₂ during the induced weather events may be attributed to physical mechanisms involving infiltration, reduced diffusivity, and gas displacement in the soil. The high volume of carbon dioxide emitted under short drought/heavy rainfall increases the availability of water-soluble carbon substrates, thereby increasing the volume of carbon dioxide that evolved.

## Conclusion

In the study of the impact of extreme weather events on the emission of carbon dioxide, the principal objective was to compare the impact of short drought/heavy rainfall and long drought/low rainfall on the emission of carbon dioxide from the soil.

The results of the study showed that emitted carbon dioxide, organic carbon, total nitrogen, and C:N varied with the induced weather events at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, and 8 weeks. Higher organic carbon, total nitrogen, and C:N were recorded under short drought/heavy rainfall (2 and 4 weeks). The volume of carbon dioxide emitted was lower in long drought/low rainfall than in short drought/heavy rainfall, with the quality of organic matter and the extent to which these organic substrates are protected from microbial attack by adsorption to clay surfaces and inclusion in micro-aggregates playing an important role in suppressing carbon dioxide production. Thus, short drought/heavy rainfall and long drought/low rainfall events could become more critical for land-atmosphere exchange and may be more important to incorporate in biogeochemical models. Advancements in this research field are likely to come from high-frequency measurements of gas fluxes, soil microbial analyses, isotope measurements, and stronger collaborations between the process-based modeling community and the experimental scientific community.
