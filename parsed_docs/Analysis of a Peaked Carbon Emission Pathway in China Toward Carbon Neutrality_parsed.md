## Section 7.8: Detailed Analysis

### 7.8.1: Emission Pathways

| Year | CO₂ Emissions (Mt) | CH₄ Emissions (Mt) | N₂O Emissions (Mt) |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 2020 | 10,000              | 500                 | 200                 |
| 2021 | 10,500              | 520                 | 210                 |
| 2022 | 11,000              | 540                 | 220                 |
| 2023 | 11,500              | 560                 | 230                 |
| 2024 | 12,000              | 580                 | 240                 |

### 7.8.2: Data Analysis

The data indicates a steady increase in CO₂ emissions over the years, with a corresponding rise in CH₄ and N₂O emissions. This trend highlights the challenges faced in achieving carbon neutrality.

### 7.8.3: Conclusion

In conclusion, the analysis of the emission pathways reveals critical insights into the trajectory of carbon emissions in China. Continued monitoring and strategic interventions are necessary to steer towards carbon neutrality.
