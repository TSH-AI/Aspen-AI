# 1. Carbon emission accounts

Since the research focuses on sectoral carbon emissions in domestic production, the import items are removed from the MRIO table to isolate the domestic supply chains in China (Zhang et al., 2017). Then the fundamental equation of input-output table (consisting of n economic sectors) can be expressed as equation

\[
x' = v I^{-1}
\]

\[
x = (I - A)^{-1} y
\]

where \( x \) represents an \( n \times 1 \) matrix of total output, \( y \) is an \( n \times 1 \) matrix of final demand, \( I \) represents the identity matrix, and \( v \) is a \( 1 \times n \) matrix of value added. \( A \) is the \( n \times n \) direct-input coefficients (technical coefficients) matrix and an element \( A_{ij} \) measures direct input from sector \( i \) to satisfy unit output of sector \( j \); \( L \) is the \( n \times n \) Leontief inverse and an element \( L_{ij} \) of \( L \) measures total input of sector \( i \) to satisfy the unit output from sector \( j \). \( B \) is the \( n \times n \) direct-output coefficients (allocation coefficients) matrix and an element \( B_{ij} \) represents the distribution of sector \( i \)’s output to sector \( j \) that purchase inputs from sector \( i \). \( G \) is the Ghosh inverse and an element \( G_{ij} \) measures the total value comes about in sector \( j \) per unit of primary input in sector \( i \) (Miller and Blair, 2009).

The environmental extension of the model introduces a \( 1 \times n \) intensity vector \( f \) representing direct emissions per unit output. Embodied emission intensity

\[
m = f I^{-1} (A)
\]

represents the embodied emissions per unit output and an element \( m_q \) measures emissions from all sectors that have become embodied in unit output from sector \( q \). Enabled emission intensity

\[
\delta = (I - B)^{-1} f
\]

measures enabled emissions per unit of input and an element \( \tilde{q} \) measures emissions from all sectors induced by per unit input of sector \( q \).

\[
S = v I^{-1} (B) f'
\]

\[
E = \hat{f} I^{-1} (A) y
\]

Then the enabled emissions and embodied emissions of various sectors can be given by equations (3) and (4). Embodied emissions include direct emissions (emissions during production activities along supply chains) and indirect emissions (emissions induced by intermediate demand along supply chains). Enabled emissions mean the emissions pulled by primary input and intermediate input along the sale chains.

# 2. Attributing emissions to primary input

Ghosh inverse matrix captures the effect of sale chains by describing both direct and indirect outputs from various sectors enabled by primary input of particular sectors. The advantage of Ghosh model is the ability to trace the emission paths through various layers pulled by primary input, which can be expanded based on Taylor series approximation as equation

\[
(I - B)^{-1} = B_0 + B_1 + B_2 + \ldots + \lim_{t \to \infty} B_t
\]

## 第 3 部分

Material flows of arbitrary sectors at arbitrary production layers driven by primary or intermediate inputs can be evaluated by referring to the equations of Table 1. If the involved production layers are greater than 4, material flows driven by primary or intermediate inputs from sector \( s_1 \) at \( PL^m \) to sector \( s_i \) at \( PL^n \) can be assessed by the following equation:

\[
S_{m \to n} = v_{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_{i-1}, s_i} B_{B:s} B_{s} \ldots B_{B}
\]

where \( i = n^m + 1 \) and \( n^m \geq 3 \).

### 3. Attributing emissions to final consumption

Leontief inverse matrix captures the effect along supply chains by depicting both direct and indirect inputs from various sectors required to satisfy the final demand of products from particular sectors. The advantage of the Leontief model is the ability to trace the emission paths through various layers instigated by final demand. The Leontief inverse can be decomposed into contributions from all supply chains, by unravelling the Leontief inverse using its series expansion as equation (7):

\[
(I - A)^{-1} = A_0 + A_1 + A_2 + \ldots + \lim_{t' \to \infty} A_t'
\]

Material flows of arbitrary sectors at arbitrary production layers pulled by final or intermediate demands can be evaluated by referring to the equations of Table 2. If the involved production layers are greater than 4, material flows pulled by the final or intermediate demands from sector \( s_1 \) at \( PL^{m'} \) to sector \( s_i \) at \( PL^{n'} \) can be assessed by the following equation:

\[
E_{m' \to n'} = m A_{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_{i-1}, s_i} A_{s_1} A_{s_1, s_2} A_{s_{i-1}, s_i} A_{s_1} : A y
\]

where \( i = m' + n' + 1 \) and \( m' n' \geq 3 \).

### 4. Emission attributions along supply chains

Along supply chains, direct emission flows (\( DE \)) and embodied emission flows (\( E \)) instigated by intermediate or final demands can also be traced at multiple production layers.

Figure S1 depicts embodied emission flows and direct emission flows pulled by the intermediate or final demands along the supply chains. \( P \) represents final production attributions of each sector, \( E_{i0}' \) measures final consumption attributions of each sector and \( E' \) is the reverse of a matrix. The figure elaborates: direct emissions from each sector at \( PL_0' \) to \( PL_3' \) - \( DE_{i0}' , DE_1' , DE_2' , \) and \( DE_3' \), respectively; embodied emissions from each sector at \( PL_0' \) to \( PL_3' \) - \( E_0' , E_1' , E_2' \) and \( E_3' \), respectively; embodied emission flows between sectors from \( PL_0' \) to \( PL_1' \), from \( PL_1' \) to \( PL_2' \), from \( PL_2' \) to \( PL_3' \) are \( E_{0'1'} , E_{1'2'} , \) and \( E_{2'3'} \). Similarly, there exist infinite production layers. The sum of final consumption attributions is equal to the sum of final production attributions, i.e.

\[
f_y + f_{Ay} + \ldots + f_{A^n} = E_i = P
\]

## 5. Intermediate, final consumption and production attributions along supply chains

Final consumption attributions of multi-production layers pulled by final demand along supply chains can be expressed as:

\[ y = fA y + fA y + fA y + \ldots + \lim_{t' \to \infty} fA y \] (10)

For sectoral production attributions at arbitrary production layers, an element \( DE_i^{t'} \) represents direct emissions released by sector \( i \) at \( PL^{t'} \). For instance, \( DE_i^{2'} = f_i A A_y \) measures direct emissions released by sector \( i \) at \( PL_2' \) in producing output to meet the intermediate demand \( A A_y \).

For consumption attributions, an element \( E_i^{t'} \) represents emissions from all sectors embodied in the output of sector \( i \) at \( PL^{t'} \). For instance, \( E_i^{2'} = m_i A A_y \) measures emissions from all sectors embodied in sector \( i \) at \( PL_2' \) to meet the intermediate demand \( A A_y \). Embodied emission intensity \( (A) \) represents the embodied emissions per unit output and an element \( m_q \) measures emissions from all sectors that have become embodied in unit output from sector \( q \).

Flows of embodied emissions between sectors from arbitrary production layers can also be derived. Equations in Table S5 are displayed to illustrate the emission from all sectors that have become embodied in the output of a given sector to meet intermediate or final demand. Specifically, \( E_{1}^{0'} \), \( E_{2}^{1'} \), and \( E_{3}^{2'} \) measure emissions embodied in the flow of intermediate products between sectors at adjacent layers. For instance, \( E_{1}^{0'} \) represents emissions from all sectors embodied in the output of sector \( j \) at \( PL_1' \) purchased by sector \( i \) at \( PL_0' \); \( E_{2}^{1'} \) measures emissions from all sectors embodied in the output of sector \( k \) at \( PL_2' \) purchased by sector \( j \) at \( PL_1' \) to meet final demand from all sectors at \( PL_0' \). The remaining equations provide more detailed extensions. For instance, \( E_{2}^{0'} \) measures emission from all sectors embodied in the output of sector \( k \) at \( PL_2' \) purchased by sector \( j \) at \( PL_1' \) to meet the final demand from sector \( i \) at \( PL_0' \). There are \( n_3 \) nodes evaluated by \( E_{2}^{0'} = m A A y \) denoting the path from “\( k \to j \to i \)”.

6. The practical significance of the application
-----------------------------------------------

Structure path analysis is an input-output technique to trace and scan entire sale and supply chains in order to extract and rank those that are significant in terms of environmental impacts. For instance, sale chain “labor→ technical service→ coal mining→ electricity-generation” has three sectors and two paths. It can be written as a structural path \( v_{LTBTCB} \), where \( B_{CE} \) is the sales coefficient of the technical services provider to the coal mine sector, \( B_{E} \) is the sales coefficient of technical service provider to coal mine sector, and \( f_{E} \) is the emission intensity of electricity-generation sector.

Supply chain “technical services→ coal mining→ electricity-generation→ household” also has three intermediate sectors and two paths. It can be written as a structural path of \( m_{A} \), where \( m_{T} \) is the emission intensity of technical-service provider, \( A_{TC} \) is the requirement coefficient of coal mine for technical service, and \( A_{CE} \) is the requirement coefficient of power plant for coal.

In the context of interconnected web of sale and supply chains, everyone is a supplier and a customer at the same time. This is true from the perspective of a corporation (buying primary and intermediate inputs, and selling intermediate and final outputs), as well as from that of a household (buying final outputs and selling primary inputs). Any effort to reduce emissions implies designing policies that allocate responsibilities to actors involved in causing these emissions. There is an implied balance in the relationship between supplier and customer: the supplier has the power to make decisions about to whom it sells (to downstream); the customer has the power to decide from whom it buys (from upstream). Every organisation is both a supplier and a purchaser, and will therefore have both sets of responsibilities.
