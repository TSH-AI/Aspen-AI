### 7.8.2 Case Study: Emission Calculation
In a case study involving the production of aluminum castings, the total emissions were calculated based on the emission factors provided above. The following calculations were performed:

1. **Total CO₂ Emission**:
- For 1000 kg of aluminum:
- \( 1000 \, \text{kg} \times 2.5 \, \text{kg CO₂/kg} = 2500 \, \text{kg CO₂} \)

2. **Total CH₄ Emission**:
- For 1000 kg of aluminum:
- \( 1000 \, \text{kg} \times 0.02 \, \text{kg CH₄/kg} = 20 \, \text{kg CH₄} \)

3. **Total N₂O Emission**:
- For 1000 kg of aluminum:
- \( 1000 \, \text{kg} \times 0.001 \, \text{kg N₂O/kg} = 1 \, \text{kg N₂O} \)

### 7.8.3 Summary of Findings
The analysis indicates that aluminum casting processes have a significant carbon footprint, primarily due to CO₂ emissions. Strategies for reducing emissions include optimizing the casting process and utilizing alternative materials with lower emission factors.

## Abstract

Sand casting is one of the cornerstones of modern industrial production, which has an important impact on resource consumption and environmental impact. In order to realize the decarbonization of sand casting, it is necessary to conduct an effective quantitative analysis of the impact of the casting production process on the environment. This study focuses on the quantitative calculation and optimization of carbon emissions in the sand mold casting process of a single casting. Based on existing research on carbon emission evaluation in the casting process, the carbon emission characteristics of energy, materials, and exhaust gases in each production stage of the casting process are analyzed. Combined with actual production process parameters, a carbon emission evaluation model for the casting process is established, which can quantitatively calculate and analyze the carbon emissions in the production process of a single casting. Then, the effectiveness of the method was verified through production examples. The results of this study can provide an effective analytical method for achieving low-carbonization in the casting process from a microscopic perspective, which will provide accurate data support for further reducing carbon emissions.

## 1 Introduction

With the intensification of human industrialization activities, more and more greenhouse gases, mainly carbon dioxide, are being emitted into the atmosphere. In order to jointly address issues such as climate change and air pollution, achieve sustainable development, and protect the Earth's environment, countries have formulated emission reduction targets and action plans, a framework and goals for global cooperation have been established by signing environmental agreements and related policies, such as the Paris Agreement (The Paris Agreement 2016). China's greenhouse gas emissions were 12,295.62 \(MtCO_{2} e\), accounting for 25.88% of global emissions and ranking first in the world (GHG Emissions 2020). The traditional casting industry,

as the foundation of China's traditional manufacturing industries, is an
important source of resource consumption and environmental pollution problems.
Its energy utilization rate is only 15% to 25%, far lower than the world's
average energy utilization rate of the casting industry. The emissions of waste
sand, slag, and exhaust gas are more than 10 times that of developed countries,
which has an urgent need for carbon reduction.

Effective assessment and analysis of casting process carbon emissions is the premise of casting carbon reduction. The current international more recognized carbon emission evaluation theory is based on the Process Life Cycle Assessment (P-LCA) and the Input–Output (I-O) method, which are the important basis for the life cycle assessment theory. P-LCA is based on activity data (AD) and emission factor (EF) to analyze carbon emissions from the bottom up, by dividing the activities of the research object into phases, counting the output list of materials, energy and pollutants involved in the process of the activity, and then summing up the total carbon emissions after combining with the product of the carbon emission factor, which is used for assessing the impacts on the environment in the process of the activity. I-O method as a convenient estimation tool, is characterized by a top-down analysis of the inputs and outputs of the relevant bill of materials in the activity process of the research object to obtain a relatively macroscopic carbon emission calculation result. Compared with P-LCA, the calculation method is simpler but lacks details, and is generally used to estimate carbon emissions and their influencing factors at the national or industrial level based on input–output tables and so on.

Scholars have conducted a series of studies on carbon emission assessment for practical application scenarios. For example, H. V. Rowley et al. compared the characteristics of two life cycle assessment methods by analyzing process inputs and outputs, proposed a hybrid life cycle assessment model to calculate the life cycle impact of the system, and demonstrated the advantages of the hybrid model over other models through an example of a water company in Sydney. Kellens et al. proposed a method for Life Cycle Assessment.

## Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for Systematic Inventory Analysis

The systematic inventory analysis of the usage stages of manufacturing unit processes provides a unit process dataset for Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) databases and libraries to account for carbon emissions in discrete part manufacturing processes.

W. Z. Bernstein et al. (2021) analyzed the relationship between the process list at each stage of the design process and the manufacturing process parameters required to generate machine level instructions, and proposed a solution that combines accurate simulation-based models with data-driven model parameter estimation to achieve accurate quantification of process inventory.

L. Zhao-hui et al. (2020) proposed a model for calculating the extended carbon emission coefficients of capital and labor, taking into account labor and capital factors. The focus of the above-mentioned carbon emission assessment research is to clarify the boundary range of the research object, define the main carbon sources within the scope, and construct a calculation method for data related to carbon sources. Currently, the carbon sources of carbon emission evaluation in various fields can be roughly divided into three categories: material, energy, and environmental emissions. In order to better evaluate the carbon emissions of the research object and trace back the main carbon sources, the quantitative calculation method of its carbon sources still needs to be reasonably designed. Therefore, a carbon emission calculation method for castings that fits the actual production scenarios is still worth studying.

In this regard, J. Zheng et al. (2018) proposed a low-carbonization process design method for sand casting based on process design parameters, and constructed three sand casting carbon source models by analyzing the process design parameters in order to predict the carbon emissions, which helps to realize the goal of low-carbon sand casting and sustainable manufacturing.

T. Sivarupan et al. (2019) studied the impact of product design and new manufacturing processes on energy consumption and CO₂ gas emissions. A life cycle approach is used to evaluate the environmental impact of 3D printing, and the carbon emissions under 3D sand casting are compared with those under traditional casting methods, to further illustrate the impact of product design and manufacturing processes on energy consumption and CO₂ emissions.

J. Zheng et al. (2021) established a carbon benefit model of functional design solutions from the perspective of time carbon benefit and economic carbon benefit, which is able to compare the differences in carbon emissions of process solutions under different production volumes, and is conducive to promoting enterprises to improve functional design and obtain feasible energy-saving and sustainable solutions.

Through the above analysis, it is found that current research on the evaluation of carbon emissions in casting mainly focuses on system level, the whole casting process of energy, material, environmental emissions statistical analysis and calculation, through the study of different processes (3D printing, sand casting, lost wax casting, etc.), or different product design parameters (mold slope, mold pulling angle, machining allowance, etc.) under the casting process carbon emission differences, to complete the low-carbonization process and product design to achieve carbon reduction. However, there is limited analysis of the production process, making it difficult to specify individual castings, and the setting of actual production process parameters (such as sand boxes, furnace material ratio schemes, etc.) can also affect the carbon emissions of castings. Therefore, further research is needed on how to systematically and comprehensively analyze the casting process and design calculation methods for carbon emissions during the casting process of individual castings. Because product design is the input of the casting production process, it is also the key to reducing carbon emissions. Especially for products with a large variety and small quantity, the setting of actual production process parameters (such as sand box, furnace ratio program, etc.) will directly affect the carbon emissions of castings. In order to achieve carbon reduction in castings through product design, it is necessary to analyze and evaluate the carbon emissions of individual castings, and then develop a carbon reduction plan based on this. However, there is currently a lack of research on carbon emissions accounting for individual castings. The differences in carbon emission accounting analysis and evaluation between batch casting and single piece casting are shown in Table 1.

### Table 1: The difference between batch and single casting carbon emission accounting

| Parameter                     | Batch Casting | Single Piece Casting |
|-------------------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Carbon Emission Factor        | X1            | Y1                   |
| Energy Consumption             | X2            | Y2                   |
| Material Usage                | X3            | Y3                   |
| Waste Generation              | X4            | Y4                   |
| Cost                          | X5            | Y5                   |

According to the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Eggleston et al. 2006), the carbon trading accounting method—emission factor method, different energy sources, materials and other emission factors are different, that is, the impact on the environment is different, therefore, through the resource allocation point of view, the design of a reasonable method can also be to a certain extent to reduce carbon emissions.

Based on the above research, this study analyzes the process of sand casting in Section 2. According to the characteristics of each casting process segment, the casting process is divided into four stages: molding, melting, recycling, and processing. The relationship between energy, material, and waste emissions and carbon emissions in each stage is analyzed in depth, and a carbon source calculation method is designed based on the process parameters.

## 2 Quantitative calculation model of carbon emissions from casting process of casting parts

The purpose of this study is to quantitatively analyze the carbon emissions of castings in the sand casting process, compare the carbon emissions between the various process segments, look for the key impact of process segments, while identifying the main sources of carbon, to provide methods and directions for the enterprise to reduce carbon. It should be noted that the scope of casting carbon emissions accounting in this paper does not include the pre-processing of raw materials to obtain processing and subsequent product end-of-life recycling stage. It only considers the casting stage of the casting, specifically including the raw materials from the workshop, through the molding, melting, recycling, machining and other four phases of the casting output process. The boundary range for carbon emission evaluation of a single casting is shown in Fig. 1.

### Fig. 1

### 2.1 Sand casting material carbon emission model

In the actual production process, part of the material consumption can be directly determined by the production process parameters, another part of the material consumption is gradually consumed over a long production process, making it difficult to specify a specific casting. It can only be determined by calculating the consumption of materials and the production of castings over a period of time. For the convenience of subsequent calculations, the former is defined as variable carbon emissions, while the latter is defined as fixed carbon emissions.

Variable carbon emissions from the molding process are mainly indirect carbon emissions from the consumption of resin sand, while carbon emissions from the recycling of used sand are categorized as energy carbon emissions in the recycling phase. The amount of resin sand used can be determined by multiplying the difference between the volume of the casting mold and the selected sand box by the density of the resin sand, the formula is as follows:
```

---

## 第 53 部分

where \(M_{b}\) is the weight of resin sand; \(\rho_{b}\) is the density of resin sand; \(V_{x}\) is the volume of sand box; \(V_{d}\) is the volume of casting. Due to the constant density of castings and resin sand, the ratio of sand consumption to casting weight is also constant when selecting castings and sand boxes. In order to simplify the subsequent calculation and facilitate parameter settings, the sand iron ratio (Zheng and Tang 2014) parameter is set to estimate the consumption of resin sand. The sand iron ratio calculation formula is as follows:

$$R^{1} = \frac{{M_{b}}}{{M_{d}}} = \frac{{\rho_{b} (V_{x} - V_{d})}}{{M_{d}}}$$

where \(M_{d}\) is the weight of the product \(d\); \(R^{1}\) is the sand-iron ratio of the product \(d\). Because the casting structure and sprue design are fixed, so the \(V_{d}\) of the same casting is a fixed value, and only \(V_{x}\) will change according to the size of the sand box, so the sand iron ratio can reflect variations due to sand box size and casting complexity. The iron-sand ratio can reflect the process design of castings, sprues, and the selection of sand boxes from the perspective of carbon emissions, so it is necessary to quantify this indicator. In the recycling stage, the sand used in molding is recycled through the sand treatment line as old sand to participate in a new round of molding process, so the actual consumption of resin sand is determined by the sand treatment first recycling rate \(\eta\), which can be concluded as:

Castings \(d\) Variable carbon emissions at the molding stage \(C_{VR}^{1,_{d}}\) can be concluded as:

$$C_{VR,d}^{1} = M_{d} R^{1} (1 - \eta) f_{b}$$

Fixed carbon emissions from castings \(d\) at the molding stage \(C_{ST,d}^{1}\) can be concluded as:

$$C_{ST,d}^{1} = \sum\limits_{c = 1}^{{c_{0}}} {M_{d}} \frac{{I_{c}^{1}}}{{O_{d}}} f_{c}$$

where \(I_{c}^{1}\) is the consumption of fixed materials \(c\) in the modeling stage over a period of time; \(c_{0}\) is the number of types of fixed materials \(c\); \(O_{d}\) is the output of casting products \(d\) over a period of time; \(f_{c}\) is the carbon emission factor of fixed materials \(c\).

---

## 第 54 部分

```markdown
The material carbon emission of the product \(d\) in the modeling stage \(CM_{d}^{1}\) is:

$$CM_{d}^{1} = M_{d} R^{1} (1 - \eta )f_{b} + \sum\limits_{c = 1}^{{c_{0} }} {M_{d} } \frac{{I_{c}^{1} }}{{O_{d} }}f_{c}$$

In the melting stage, the material carbon emission is mainly reflected in the indirect carbon emission generated by the consumption of raw materials such as scrap steel, pig iron, carburizer, and other molten iron. The determination of the amount of molten iron needs to be considered to set a reasonable amount of make-up and shrinkage, and the amount of each raw material input can be obtained through the calculation of the ratio of molten iron to the amount of raw material input, so that the material carbon emission in this stage is equal to the variable carbon emission.

The carbon emissions of the materials in the melting stage \(CM_{d}^{2}\) is:

$$CM_{d}^{2} = \sum\limits_{g = 1}^{{g_{0} }} {M_{d} } (1 + M_{IR} )R_{g}^{2} f_{g}$$

where \(M_{d}\) is the weight of the product \(d\); \(M_{IR}\) is the ratio of the casting pouring iron shrinkage to the weight of the casting; \(g_{0}\) represents the number of types of iron raw materials; \(R_{g}^{2}\) is the ratio of the iron raw materials \(g\) to the total weight of the iron; \(f_{g}\) is the carbon emission coefficient of the iron raw material \(g\).

Carbon emissions at the recycling stage and the processing stage are indirect carbon emissions generated by the continuous material loss as the product is processed, so the carbon emissions at these two stages are equal to the fixed carbon emissions.

The carbon emissions of materials in the recycling phase is:

$$CM_{d}^{3} = \sum\limits_{c = 1}^{{c_{0} }} {M_{d} } \frac{{I_{c}^{3} }}{{O_{d} }}f_{c}$$

Carbon emissions from materials in the processing stage is:

$$CM_{d}^{4} = \sum\limits_{c = 1}^{{c_{0} }}  {M_{d} } \frac{{I_{c}^{4} }}{{O_{d} }}f_{c}$$

where \(CM_{d}^{3}\) is the carbon emissions of materials at the recycling stage; \(CM_{d}^{4}\) is the carbon emissions of materials at the processing stage; \(I_{c}^{3}\) is the consumption of stationary materials at the recycling stage over a period of time \(c\); and \(I_{c}^{4}\) is the consumption of stationary materials at the processing stage over a period of time \(c\).

According to the Eqs. (5) to (8) can be obtained casting process of castings \(d\) material carbon emissions \(CM_{d}\) for:

$$CM_{d} = M_{d} R^{1} (1 - \eta )f_{b} + \sum\limits_{a =

## 2.2 Sand casting energy carbon emission modeling

The energy carbon emissions during the casting process are mainly reflected in the carbon emissions generated by the electricity consumption of processing equipment and transportation equipment, and the electricity consumption can be obtained by the power method (Huang 2019). The energy and carbon emissions in the molding stage are mainly reflected in the electricity consumption of the sand mixer \(l\) and crane \(m^{1}\), the energy carbon emissions in the melting stage are mainly reflected in the electricity consumption of the melting furnace \(n\) and crane \(m^{2}\), the energy carbon emissions in the recycling stage are mainly reflected in the electricity consumption of the sand processing recycling line \(o\) and crane \(m^{3}\), and the energy carbon emissions in the processing stage are mainly reflected in the electricity consumption of the shot blasting machine \(u\) and crane \(m^{4}\).

During the molding phase, the energy consumption of the sand mixer is influenced by the quantity of sand mixed and the machine's own mixing rate, and cranes are mainly used to transport the workpieces between the different process areas during the molding process.

The energy carbon emissions of the casting \(d\) at the molding stage \(CE_{d}^{1}\) can be concluded as:

$$

## 2.3 Sand casting waste carbon emission modeling

The carbon emissions from waste are mainly reflected in the forms of smoke, exhaust gas, and solids generated during the casting process. The smoke, exhaust gas, and other waste materials are uniformly recycled and treated through smoke and dust treatment equipment, while solid waste materials are uniformly recycled and treated through handling equipment. Therefore, the carbon emissions from waste materials can be calculated based on the energy consumption of smoke and dust treatment equipment and handling equipment during waste treatment.

In the molding stage, the main waste carbon emissions are the dust generated by the sand mixing processed by the fume treatment equipment \(w\) and the energy consumption generated by the non-methane hydrocarbons generated in the core molding process. In the melting stage, the main source of carbon emissions is the carbon emissions generated from the treatment of waste such as electric furnace slag and smelting furnace smoke and dust. During the solidification process, the carbon emissions come from the carbon emissions caused by the thermal decomposition of furan resin sand (Li et al. 2023), which are included in the unified calculation of the modeling stage. In the recycling stage, it is mainly reflected in the dust generated in the process of sand fall and old sand recycling, and the carbon emission generated by waste sand treatment. However, the energy consumption in the process of waste sand treatment is the energy consumption of the sand treatment line, which has been included in the carbon emission of energy in the recycling stage, so only the carbon emission generated by the recycling of smoke and other flue gas waste is counted here; and the carbon emission generated by the machining stage is the carbon emission from the treatment of the fumes generated by the shot blasting, sanding and other processes. In the machining stage, it is the carbon emission generated from the processing of blasting and sanding.

Waste carbon emissions from castings \(d\) at the molding stage \(CU_{d}^{1}\) can be expressed as:

$$
CU_{d}^{1} = \sum\limits_{{w^{1} = 1}}^{{w_{0}^{1} }} {M_{d} } p_{{w^{1} }} \frac{{M_{{U^{1} }}^{1} }}{{v_{{w^{1} }} *1000}}f_{e}
$$

where \(v_{{w^{1}}}\) is the waste treatment rate of the fume recovery equipment at the molding stage \(w^{1}\); \(p_{{w^{1}}}\) is the power of the fume recovery equipment at the molding stage \(w^{1}\); \(w_{0}^{1}\) is the number of fume recovery equipment at the molding stage; \(M_{{U^{1}}}^{1}\) is the amount of fume-type waste generated at the molding stage \(U^{1}\) for a single tonnage of casting; \(M_{d}\) is the weight of the casting \(d\); and \(f_{e}\) is the carbon emission factor of the electricity.

The above parameters are substituted into the formula to calculate and analyze the carbon emission accounting results of the No. 1 and No. 2 locking disc sand casting process, as shown in Table 7, taking the No. 1 locking disc as an example, the carbon emission evaluation report is shown in 3.

### TABLE 7 Breakdown of carbon emissions

| Stage          | Carbon Emissions (kgCO₂e) | Percentage of Total (%) |
|----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Melting        | 47,800.000                 | 99.14                   |
| Molding        | 255.000                    | 0.53                    |
| Machining      | 150.000                    | 0.31                    |
| Recycling      | 0.005                      | 0.02                    |

From the layout of the casting workshop in Fig. 3, the following information can be obtained:

1. The total carbon emissions during the casting process of locking disk No. 1 is 48,180.455 kgCO₂e, the melting stage contributes to the largest carbon emissions, accounting for 99.14% of the total carbon emissions, followed by the molding stage, accounting for about 0.53% of the total, then the machining stage, accounting for about 0.31% of the total, and the least for the recycling stage, accounting for about 0.02% of the total. From this, the following conclusion can be drawn: the melting process is the main carbon emission impact link of No.1 locking disk sand casting process, and the overall carbon emission ratio from largest to smallest is: melting stage > molding stage > machining stage > recycling stage.

2. The carbon emissions generated by the resin sand consumption of the No. 2 locking disc increased by 41.97% compared with the No. 1 locking disc, and the corresponding carbon emissions of materials in the modeling stage also increased by 22.27% compared with the No. 1 locking disc, because the No. 2 locking disc chose other spare sand boxes due to the insufficient sand box at the production site, which increased the amount of resin sand, increased the sand to iron ratio, and increased the working time of the sand mixer in the molding stage and the sand processing line in the recycling stage. As a result, the energy and carbon emissions of the processing equipment in the modeling stage and recycling stage increased by 41.97% and 41.86% respectively compared with the No. 1 locking disc. In terms of material carbon emissions in the smelting stage, the value of No. 2 locking disc is 0.14% lower than that of No. 1 locking disc due to a certain change in the proportion of raw materials. Compared with the No. 1 locking disk, the No. 2 locking disc is assigned to the No. 2 team to assist in production due to its excessive production tasks, and its product production route has changed to a certain extent, and the overall transportation distance is 50m more than that of the No. 1 locking disc, and the corresponding carbon emission of its transportation...

## Section 7.8: Carbon Emissions Analysis

1. Energy consumption is increased by 20.02% compared with that of the No. 1 locking disc.

2. Combined with the proportion of carbon emissions in the carbon emission details table, it can be seen that the carbon emissions of materials in the modeling stage mainly come from the consumption of resin sand. Therefore, it can be considered to reduce the carbon emission in the molding stage by reducing the consumption of resin sand, i.e., controlling the ratio of sand to iron, or replace resin sand with greener materials. In the melting stage, the main carbon source comes from the carbon emission generated by the consumption of iron raw materials. The amount of iron is mainly affected by the weight of the customer's product demand, and the setting of the amount of iron make-up and shrinkage. In addition, since there are many types of iron raw materials, the consumption of different raw materials has different impacts on the environment. Therefore, the appropriate ratio of raw materials will also have a certain degree of control effect on the carbon emission of the materials in the melting stage.

3. The difference between it and Case No. 1 and Case No. 2 is that the sand box selection scheme is different, the transportation route is different, and the actual feeding ratio has a slight change. The carbon emissions generated by the two locking discs due to the raw materials are shown in Fig. 4.

### Fig. 4
!Carbon emissions from raw materials and total carbon emissions of locking discs No. 1 and No. 2 (kgCO₂)

To quantify the impact of each raw material on total carbon emissions, a Sensitivity Index can be calculated. The sensitivity index is a measure of the impact of changes in the independent variable (parameter) on the dependent variable (total carbon emissions). The sensitivity index is equal to the change in total carbon emissions...

## Table 8 Main element burning loss rate (%)

| Element          | Burning Loss Rate (%) |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| Silicon Carbide  |                       |
| Other Elements    |                       |

The analysis shows that the absolute value of the sensitivity coefficient of silicon carbide is the largest. This is because silicon carbide has the highest carbon content, and its change has the greatest impact on the total carbon emissions.

## Conclusion

The purpose of this study is to establish a quantitative calculation model applicable to the carbon emissions for a single casting process, evaluate carbon emissions of the casting production process, identify the main carbon emissions and key carbon sources, provide feasible optimization solutions, provide data support for enterprise management decision-making, and achieve the goal of carbon reduction and efficiency improvement. The conclusions drawn from the analysis and modeling based on application cases are as follows:

1. The melting process is the main carbon emission impact link of the sand casting process, and the overall carbon emissions of castings are ranked in descending order as follows: carbon emissions from the melting stage > carbon emissions from the molding stage > carbon emissions from the machining stage > carbon emissions from the recycling stage.
2. The main carbon source in the melting stage comes from the material carbon emission generated by the consumption of iron raw materials. Based on the analysis of its basic calculation model, the carbon reduction can be carried out through the product weight reduction, the adjustment of the value of the iron make-up shrinkage, and the adjustment of the ratio of iron raw materials.

Although a carbon emission evaluation model for individual castings was established in this study, there are still some shortcomings due to the limitations of current actual casting process conditions. In the future, in-depth research should be carried out from the following aspects:

- When accounting for energy consumption and carbon emissions, due to the lack of real-time data acquisition of the processing and transportation energy consumption of the equipment, it is only indirectly obtained through the statistics of a period of time by the average casting electricity consumption or equipment electricity and running time. If energy consumption monitoring schemes are designed for equipment such as sand mixers, gantry cranes, and intermediate frequency furnaces, it will be beneficial to...

## Section 7.8: Carbon Emission Calculation

### 7.8.1 Methodology

The methodology for calculating carbon emissions from sand casting involves several steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on materials used, energy consumption, and production processes.
2. **Emission Factors**: Utilize established emission factors for each material and energy source.
3. **Calculation**: Apply the formula:
\[
\text{Total Emissions} = \sum (\text{Quantity} \times \text{Emission Factor})
\]

### 7.8.2 Case Study

A case study was conducted on a specific casting process. The following data was collected:

| Material                | Quantity | Emission Factor | Total Emissions |
|-------------------------|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Sand                    | 500 kg   | 0.02 kg/kg      | 10 kg            |
| Metal                   | 200 kg   | 0.05 kg/kg      | 10 kg            |
| Energy                  | 100 kWh  | 0.5 kg/kWh      | 50 kg            |
| **Total**              |          |                 | **70 kg**        |

### 7.8.3 Results

The results of the carbon emission calculations indicate that the total emissions for the casting process are 70 kg CO₂ equivalent. This highlights the importance of optimizing material usage and energy consumption to reduce overall emissions.
