# Impact of Corporate Green Innovation on Carbon Emission Efficiency based on Carbon Emission Policies

**Abstract:** The issue of climate warming, resulting from elevated carbon emissions, has emerged as a crucial concern for the survival and progress of humanity. Achieving the "dual-carbon" objective necessitates the utilization of technological advancements. This study aims to theoretically investigate the mechanisms through which green technological innovation influences firms' carbon emissions, focusing on the perspectives of industrial restructuring and reducing carbon emission intensity. This research intends to employ the SBM model using provincial panel data spanning from 2017 to 2022, focusing on the regional level in China. Additionally, this study examines the temporal and spatial changes of the variable under investigation and employs the two-way fixed effect model for conducting econometric research. This paper uses the methods of literature analysis, principal component analysis, regression analysis, heterogeneity analysis, and benchmark regression analysis to deeply analyze the development status of green technological innovation in the classification of resource-based cities and low-carbon development demonstration cities in China and to identify the existing problems. The research findings indicate that implementing significant green technology advances can result in a notable increase in the carbon emissions of organizations. Even with this, the impact on strategic green technology developments is not statistically significant in many rigorous tests, including altering explanatory factors, using shorter periods, and doing tail-shrinking tests. Additionally, the presence of heterogeneity is taken into account. The impact above plays a crucial part in the economic development of our nation. The empirical analysis reveals that the process of enhancing carbon emission reduction efficiency in China is significantly influenced by upgrading industrial structure and reducing carbon emission intensity. Building upon this finding, policy recommendations are proposed to guide China in implementing green technological innovation.

**Key-Words:** carbon policy, green innovation, carbon efficiency, heterogeneity analysis, SBM model.

## 1 Introduction

Global warming and its associated consequences, including but not limited to El Niño, droughts, and species extinction, have emerged as the foremost peril to the long-term viability of the human species and the promotion of sustainable progress on a global scale. Global climate change is a serious issue currently facing us, and carbon emission policies play a crucial role in mitigating climate change. Carbon emissions mainly come from human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, industrial production, and deforestation. These activities release a large amount of greenhouse gases, leading to issues such as rising Earth temperatures, increasing extreme weather events, and rising sea levels. The need to put in place workable and efficient safety measures has increased due to a variety of issues. To minimize carbon emissions using market mechanisms, such as taxing carbon emissions or introducing carbon trading systems, the establishment of carbon pricing is supported. In addition to reducing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering carbon emissions, this can also encourage businesses and individuals to adopt more environmentally friendly practices, invest in and support renewable energy sources like solar and wind, establish and enforce energy efficiency standards, and encourage industries and individuals to adopt more energy-efficient machinery and technologies. Because forests are significant carbon sinks, maintaining and reforesting them can help absorb carbon dioxide and slow down the rate of climate change. As a worldwide concern, climate change calls for cooperation from all nations. Through international cooperation, technology, and...

## 2.1 Green Technology Innovation Promotes Carbon Emission Efficiency through Upgrading the Industrial Structure

The integration of technological innovation plays a crucial role in facilitating the advancement of China's industrial framework and significantly impacting the country's economic progress. Green technological innovation enables the streamlining and improvement of industrial design, hence fostering the enhancement of industrial facilities. This paper discusses the application of new technologies in reducing resource consumption, particularly regarding energy and raw materials. It also explores the potential benefits of integrating human capital and means of production to enhance overall resource efficiency. Building upon these ideas, the paper introduces a novel development concept that focuses on optimizing the allocation of production factors. The objective is to maximize production efficiency within each industry and improve.

In contrast, it employs energy-saving, emission-reducing, and other environmentally friendly technologies to renew and innovate manufacturing processes and equipment, thereby promoting environmental protection. Encourage enterprises to transition from the conventional labor-intensive, single-production mode characterized by high pollution and energy consumption to a comprehensive service mode that is capital- and technology-intensive, low in energy consumption, and high in value-added. This transition aims to enhance the production process's energy efficiency, cleanliness, and innovation, thereby promoting the deep processing of existing products to increase their added value and achieve product upgrading. Simultaneously, it can generate correlation effects on both upstream and downstream sectors, bolster the resilience of the current industrial chain, prolong the industrial value chain, and achieve an advanced industrial structure. In the context of China, it can be observed that there exists a negative correlation between the scale of industrial production and carbon emissions. Specifically, as the scale of industrial production increases, there is a corresponding decrease in carbon emissions.

### 2.2 Green Technology Innovation Improves Carbon Efficiency by Reducing Carbon Intensity

Carbon intensity refers to the carbon emissions resulting from the realization of one unit of economic efficiency. It refers to the ratio of total carbon emissions to the total output of the local economy. Carbon emission efficiency refers to GDP as the expected output, while carbon dioxide emissions are a composite indicator of undesired production and, therefore, negatively correlated with carbon emission intensity. Most of this comes from energy used in business activities and the generation of various wastes. Fossil energy sources, mainly coal, oil, and gas, have considerable pollution and carbon emissions. Depending on the waste generated, the trash can also be categorized as primary, secondary, etc.

The innovation of green technology, fuel ratio optimization, iterative decarbonization pretreatment technology, etc., has optimized carbon reduction by reducing energy consumption from the source. At the same time, it can also be used to increase the emission devices at the online end to reduce the productive carbon emissions during the production process. In addition, the reuse of primary and secondary waste can also contribute to the reduction of final carbon emissions so that the economic benefits obtained can be maintained, based on which the carbon dioxide emissions can be further reduced to improve the efficiency of carbon emission issues. On the other hand, the primary and secondary waste generated throughout the production process can be recycled and reused to achieve the purpose of the production cycle so that the trash can be resourceful, that the efficiency of the comprehensive utilization of resources can be better improved, so that the original carbon emissions can be reduced or maintained at the same time, to obtain more economic benefits, which can reduce carbon emission intensity.

### Research Hypotheses

Based on the above analysis of the mechanism of action, the following hypotheses were proposed in this study:

- **Research Hypothesis 1:** Green technology innovation of enterprises can improve the carbon emission efficiency of enterprises.
- **Research Hypothesis 2:** The impacts of two types of green technology innovations, strategic and practical, on the carbon emission efficiency of enterprises, are different.

### 3.1 Sample Selection and Data Sources

(1) Defined benefit model
A fixed‑effects model is proposed, which can better deal with missing variables due to individuals, time, and other factors, which is shown in equation (1).
CEEit = Ã₀ + Ã₁GTIit(LnGTIP, LnGTA) + Ã₂Controlit + ui + ₜ + Æit (1)

Æit represents individual effects that do not change over time, means timeliness that does not change with individuals, and is a random disturbance term.

(2) Super‑efficient SBM model
Assuming the existence of n active DMUs and setting P as the output probability, P can be expressed as equation (2).
P = (Σ x, Σ y) | x > 0, y > 0 (2)

Energy efficiency: Energy is China's largest carbon emissions source. However, the current coal‑dominated energy structure and utilization still need to be more crude, leading to a tremendous waste of energy resources and environmental pollution. Improving energy efficiency is the key to addressing future energy security and climate change. The author takes the development of clean energy and improvement of energy efficiency as a prerequisite, improves the electrification level, promotes the low‑carbon and efficient use of energy, improves energy efficiency under the same energy demand, and reduces energy consumption and carbon emissions under the same economic output. On this basis, China's energy consumption proportion to GDP is analyzed. Regarding the configuration of industries, there has been a decline in the share of national revenue and labor force attributed to the primary sector, alongside a simultaneous increase in the prominence of the secondary and tertiary sectors. The rational arrangement and optimization adjustment of the industrial structure hold significant practical importance in facilitating the transformation and advancement of China's high‑tech industries.

## Empirical Results

### 4.1 Benchmark Regression

**Table 5 (Appendix)** presents the findings of the baseline regressions, with columns 1 to 3 representing the strategic individual fixed effects of the superficial green technological innovation model, the two-way locked effects model, and the fixed two-way impact mixed with control variables, respectively. The substantive model of personal fixed effects in green technology innovation, the two-way lock-in effects model, and the two-way directed products combined with control variables are represented in columns 4 through 6, respectively.

Upon careful examination of columns 1 to 2, it becomes evident that, following the adjustment for individual effects, the coefficient of the impact of strategic green technological innovation on carbon dioxide release efficiency is 0.03249. The statistical significance of the outcome is evaluated at a significance level of 5%. However, including the concept of "time-locking" demonstrates that implementing strategic green technical innovation does not yield a substantial enhancement in carbon emission efficiency.

The findings indicate that, with a confidence level of 10%, the implementation of green technological innovation has a substantial positive impact on the carbon emission efficiency of urban areas. Green patent applications are commonly used to assess engagement in green innovation endeavors. The presence of green technology patents indicates the extent of technological innovation undertaken by a company in the realm of environmentally sustainable production.

## Section 7.8: Green Technological Innovation and Carbon Emission Efficiency

Nevertheless, when considering the patents indicates the extent of technological implementation of "time‑locking," it becomes evident that the efficacy of strategic green technology innovation in enhancing carbon emission efficiency is limited. One potential explanation is that purposeful and straightforward green technical innovation primarily involves strengthening the structure and integrating the aesthetics of existing products, resulting in a simplistic design approach. The application process's duration is significantly shorter compared to the implementation of substantial green technology innovations. The absence of assistance in the current production process results in a negligible effect on the emissions of solid carbon dioxide. The coefficient of influence of green technological breakthroughs on CO₂ emissions has been examined in Column 5, revealing a statistically significant value of 0.0384 at a significance level of 5%. Based on the findings shown in Column 6, it is evident that including various control factors has resulted in an impact coefficient of 0.0249 for meaningful green technological innovation on carbon emissions. Simultaneously, it satisfies the 10% significance threshold, suggesting that green technical improvements have a statistically significant impact on enhancing carbon emission efficiency.

The research findings indicate a positive correlation between the implementation of practical green technological innovation and the extent of improvement in carbon emission efficiency. Specifically, the study reveals that for every unit rise in practical green technological innovation, there is a corresponding increase in carbon emission efficiency by 2.49%. The research above findings validate the first hypothesis, which posits that implementing green technology innovation has the potential to enhance the carbon emission efficiency of firms. The conclusion above aligns with the findings in columns 1-3, indicating that substantial green technical innovation positively impacts carbon emission efficiency. In contrast, strategic green technological innovation does not yield the same effect. The study above provides evidence supporting hypothesis 2, which posits a disparity in carbon emission efficiency between the "practical" and "substantive" forms of green technology creation.

The findings indicate that, with a confidence level of 10%, the implementation of green technological innovation has a substantial positive impact on the carbon emission efficiency of urban areas. Green patent applications are commonly used to assess engagement in green innovation endeavors. The presence of green technology...

|--------|-------------|-------|
| 1      | Coefficient of influence on CO₂ emissions | 0.0384 |
| 2      | Impact coefficient for meaningful green technological innovation | 0.0249 |
| 3      | Increase in carbon emission efficiency per unit rise in practical green technological innovation | 2.49% |

| 1          | Implementing green technology innovation enhances carbon emission efficiency | Yes |
| 2          | Disparity in carbon emission efficiency between practical and substantive forms of green technology | Yes |

The transition from labor-intensive, resource-based industries to technology-based sectors can be realized by leveraging knowledge-intensive industrial transfers. Consequently, a shift from a "high carbon" urban development model to a "low carbon" one is proposed, thereby promoting cities' coordinated green and low-carbon development.

Green technological innovation is still an effective way to promote carbon emission reduction, and the results show that the influence coefficient of each factor is 17.3%, which is qualified by a 5% significance test.

Green technology innovation plays a crucial role in improving the carbon emission efficiency of enterprises, and in-depth research is conducted on the specific impact of different green technology innovations on carbon emission efficiency. Through empirical research and data analysis, quantify the carbon emission reduction effects of various green technologies in different industries, and provide more specific guidance for enterprises in technology selection and implementation. In addition to carbon emission efficiency, research should also focus on the impact of green technology innovation on corporate economic performance. This includes the effects of cost reduction, market competitiveness improvement, and sustainable operation, providing a more comprehensive evaluation for enterprise decision-making. Enterprises analyze the dissemination and impact of green technology innovation throughout the entire supply chain, understand the actual effects of applying green technology in procurement, production, and sales, and optimize the carbon emission efficiency of the entire value chain. Simultaneously examine the promoting effect of carbon emission policies in different countries and regions on green technology innovation in enterprises. At the same time, pay attention to factors such as policy uncertainty and support, analyze the impact on green technology innovation in enterprises, and provide a reference for the government to formulate more effective policies.

This result indicates that the improvement in carbon emission efficiency in pilot provinces and cities is mainly due to the balanced contribution of various factors, rather than the dominant role of a specific factor. Heterogeneity analysis further reveals the possible diversity between pilot and non-pilot provinces and cities. This heterogeneity may stem from factors such as different industrial structures, energy combinations, and policy implementation effects in different regions. For example, some regions may focus more on promoting renewable energy technologies, while others may place more emphasis on improving energy efficiency and introducing carbon capture technologies. This in-depth heterogeneity analysis provides important references for future carbon trading policies and green technology innovation. Policymakers can adjust policy directions based on the characteristics.

## Results and Discussion

This study aims to comprehensively examine the impact of China's green technology innovation on its carbon emission efficiency, employing both theoretical and empirical approaches. This study examines the carbon emission efficiency of different inter-provincial regions in China throughout 2017-2022. The findings reveal distinct spatial variations in the Yangtze, Pearl, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, and Qinghai regions. The implementation of green technological innovation has the potential to enhance firms' carbon emission efficiency significantly. This positive impact is primarily observed in important green technological innovations, whereas strategic technological innovations do not exhibit the same influence. The conclusions above were derived via a sequence of rigorous robustness tests. The author's analysis of heterogeneity reveals a notable disparity between the degree of green technological innovation and the level of carbon emission efficiency in China's pilot regions to reform the country's carbon trading system. Conversely, the disparity between these two factors is not statistically significant in non-pilot areas. Building upon these findings, the author proposes policy recommendations to enhance industrial structure and reduce carbon emission intensity. The results of the research yield the subsequent observations:

Local governments and enterprises should actively facilitate the advancement of green technological innovation. This can be achieved by augmenting the allocation of national scientific research funds, establishing a dedicated fund specifically for green technological innovation, and determining research and development priorities as well as critical directions to enhance innovation in green technology. By implementing a strategy that integrates industry and education, the government can guide and support enterprises in green technology innovation. This can be achieved through a collaborative effort involving university research and development, enterprise demand, and targeted financial assistance. Such measures aim to mitigate uncertainties faced by enterprises and enhance their motivation to innovate in green technology. Ultimately, these initiatives seek to elevate the amount of green technology innovation among firms in China.

## Conclusion

The realization of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality is a universal, extensive, fundamental, global, and comprehensive transformation. With the achievement of the "dual carbon" goal, China's traditional high-input and high-emission economic growth model is shifting towards a high-quality growth model driven by technological innovation. This project will analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of green technology innovation and carbon emission efficiency in China from the perspective of economic geography, establish an analysis framework for its influencing factors, reveal its mechanism of action, and based on this, combine with the actual situation in China to propose corresponding policy recommendations.

There are still shortcomings in the research content and methods of this paper, which need to be further improved in the future. The content of future research should be further strengthened at the policy level, and quantitative methods should be further developed at the methodological level.

Due to significant differences in geographical location, economic growth, industrial structure, and technological principles among different regions, it is necessary to select typical regions for empirical research, comprehensively evaluate their level of green technology innovation and carbon emissions, and propose corresponding countermeasures and suggestions accordingly.

Against the backdrop of carbon emission policies gradually becoming an important factor in the business environment of enterprises, this study analyzes the relationship between green innovation and carbon emission efficiency in enterprises. Under the guidance of carbon emission policies, enterprises actively engage in green innovation, which has a significant positive impact on improving carbon emission efficiency. By introducing more environmentally friendly and low-carbon production technologies and management models, enterprises can reduce carbon emissions, improve resource utilization efficiency, and achieve a win-win situation of economic and environmental benefits.

It is impossible to overlook how carbon emission regulations encourage green innovation in businesses. Businesses are compelled to go toward a more sustainable development path by government regulations and limits on carbon emissions. During this process, businesses not only look for technological innovations to break new ground, but they also modify their operations and management to comply with carbon emission regulations. Green innovation is rarely instantaneous, though, and businesses may experience challenges and financial constraints.
