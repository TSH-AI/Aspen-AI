**ABSTRACT:** We studied monatomic linear carbon chains stabilized by gold nanoparticles attached to their ends and deposited on a solid substrate. We observe spectral features of straight chains containing from 8 to 24 atoms. Low-temperature PL spectra reveal characteristic triplet fine structures that repeat themselves for carbon chains of different lengths. The triplet is invariably composed of a sharp intense peak accompanied by two broader satellites situated 15 and 40 meV below the main peak. We interpret these resonances as an edge-state neutral exciton and positively and negatively charged trions, respectively. The time-resolved PL shows that the radiative lifetime of the observed quasiparticles is about 1 ns, and it increases with the increase of the length of the chain. At high temperatures a nonradiative exciton decay channel appears due to the thermal hopping of carriers between parallel carbon chains. Excitons in carbon chains possess large oscillator strengths and extremely low inhomogeneous broadenings.

**KEYWORDS:** carbon chains, excitons, photoluminescence spectra, nanoparticles

Several types of low-dimensional crystals based on carbon were attracting the attention of the physical and chemical research communities in the XXI century. Nanodiamonds, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene demonstrate a variety of interesting and unusual electronic properties that make them promising for a variety of applications in nanoelectronics and photonics. One of the most challenging goals for the nanofabrication technology is the realization of ultimate one-dimensional crystals, monatomic chains of sp-carbon. Traces of two stable allotropes of sp-carbon (polyyne and cumulene) have been found in nature: in meteorite craters, interstellar dust, natural graphite, and diamond mines. The high chemical reactivity of linear acetylenic carbon and its low stability at room temperature and atmospheric pressure make it difficult to extract freestanding carbon chains from natural sources. Moreover, multiple attempts to synthesize polyyne chains artificially have yielded modest or no success so far. Until now, to the best of our knowledge, stable freestanding samples of straight carbon chains have not yet been realized. Their synthesis appears to be a formidable challenge as, in general, infinite one-dimensional atomic chains are unstable in vacuum. According to the Landau theorem, fluctuations prevent the formation of ideal one-dimensional crystals. Therefore, many works have been devoted to the artificial stabilization of carbon chains. The stabilization may be achieved by the use of heavy anchor atomic groups. The fabrication of carbon chains with in situ TEM allowed the production of chains of about 5 nm in length. The synthesis of carbon chains inside double-wall nanotubes was shown to be an efficient way for the realization of macroscopically long carbon isolated from the environment. The stabilization of carbon chains by the tris(3,5-di-t-butylphenyl)methyl moiety led to the observation of a record 44 atom long freestanding chain. One-dimensional carbon crystals are expected to exhibit unique mechanical, optical, and electronic properties. According to the recent theoretical works, one-dimensional carbon chains could form the most robust of all known crystals. It may take one of two allotropic forms: cumulene, where neighboring carbon atoms are linked with double electronic bonds, and polyyne, where single and triple electronic bonds alternate. Note that here we mean by polyyne a series of consecutive alkynes, (−C≡C−)ₙ with n greater than 1 and is not necessarily ended by hydrogen atoms. In polyyne, the interatomic distances are predicted to be 0.133 nm (C−C).

The interatomic separations are significantly less than those in graphite where the spacing between neighboring atoms is 0.142 nm, while the spacing between atomic planes is 0.335 nm. This is why the predicted Young’s modulus of linear carbon chains is somewhat higher than in graphene and an order of magnitude higher than that of diamond. Ab initio calculations show that infinite-chain polyyne is a direct band gap semiconductor, with a gap of 2.58 eV. Our own ab initio calculations of the band structure of stabilized infinite polyyne chains predict the existence of a direct electronic band gap of 2.7 eV at the edge of the Brillouin zone. Being direct-gap semiconductors, polyyne chains are expected to possess unusual optical properties. In particular, their nonlinear optical response is expected to be giant.

Indeed, unlike graphite or graphene which are strong absorbers and do not emit light and carbon nanotubes where the multivalley band structure leads to dark excitons suppressing the luminescence, one-dimensional carbon crystals are attractive because of their ability to emit visible light. Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectra of carbon chains previously reported demonstrate a sequence of broad maxima corresponding to the chains of different lengths. The band gap of finite size linear chains dramatically depends on the number of carbon atoms in a chain, getting larger in shorter chains.

In the following, we shall focus on straight polyyne chains containing from 8 to 24 carbon atoms whose band structure is reduced to a sequence of discrete energy levels. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra show that the radiative lifetime of the observed transitions is of the order of 1 ns, which is similar to the data reported for excitons in carbon nanotubes (CNTs). At high temperatures, the double exponential decay of the PL signal is observed.

## Figure 2. Deposition and characterization of carbon chains

(a) Illustration of our method of deposition of the aligned carbon chains stabilized by gold NPs of different sizes. Due to the difference in work functions of gold nanoparticles attached to the ends of a carbon chain, it becomes dipole polarized. The external electric field orients the polarized chains, so that over a half of them appear to be aligned when deposited on a substrate by sputtering.

(b) Schematics of the structure of a quasicrystal formed by polyyne wires attached to a gold NP (shown as a yellow wall) that is based on the X-ray diffraction analysis.

(c) HR TEM image of bundles of carbon chains attached to two gold NPs of a nearly spherical shape, seen as the dark regions on the left-hand side and right-hand sides of the image. The observed quasicrystal structure is composed by sp-carbon polyyne chains and represents a van der Waals quasicrystal. Its lattice parameters are a = 0.926 nm and c = 1.25 nm, and the polyyne lattice constant is d = 0.2558 nm. In this case, the distance between neighboring chains in the hexagon is 0.535 nm, in full agreement with the HR TEM image of the central part of the field oriented bundle shown in part d. The green area corresponds to the field-aligned polarized chains end-capped with Au NPs; the red area is occupied by randomly oriented unpolarized chains.

The observed thermal dissociation of excitons is characterized by a fast exponential, and the slow exponential corresponds to their radiative decay. The exciton radiative lifetime decreases with the decrease of the length of the chain. We refer to the Su−Schrieffer−Heeger model to argue that the transition that dominates low-temperature PL spectra is based on the edge electronic states that form the HOMO−LUMO pair in carbon chains stabilized by gold NPs. This interpretation is confirmed by the ab initio calculation (Figure 5e−g).

## Results. Synthesis of Monatomic Carbon Chains

We employed the LAL method for synthesis of the linear carbon chains. The laser processing resulted in the formation of polyyne threads. The stabilization of linear carbon chains is achieved by adding spherical gold NPs to the solution. The procedure is schematically illustrated in Figure 1c. NPs having average sizes of either 10 or 100 nm attach themselves to the ends of carbon chains by single electron bonds. As the folding of chains and formation of kinks also occur predominantly at the single bonds, the parity rule is imposed to the number of atoms belonging to straight parts of the chains. Here, in particular, we observe spectral resonances of the straight chains containing even numbers of C atoms ranging from 8 to 24. Typically, these are straight parts of longer linear chains attached by both ends to gold NPs. Kinks separate each linear chain into several straight parts. It is important to note also that if NPs at the opposite ends of a carbon chain are of different sizes, the difference of their work functions results in...

(a) Spectra taken at temperatures from 90 to 50 K (red curve corresponds to 90 K, yellow curve to 80 K, green curve to 70 K, teal curve to 60 K, and blue curve to 50 K). The laser excitation wavelength is 390 nm with the intensity of 5 mW and the acquisition time of 10 s. (b) PL spectra taken at 4 K.

The blue points show the nonradiative decay times, extracted from the room temperature TRPL curves in part a.

The charging of the carbon−NP complex that acquires a stationary dipole moment. This dipole polarization provides a tool for the chain ordering by an applied voltage. We note that only about one-half of carbon bundles have gold NPs of different sizes (10 and 100 nm, typically) at their ends. These bundles are dipole polarized due to the difference of the work function of gold NPs of different sizes. They are aligned by the electric field during the sputtering process. As a result, we were able to deposit long parallel chains of polyyne.

Figure 2c shows the HR TEM image of a typical bundle of carbon chains attached by both of its ends to gold NPs. Figure 2d shows the HR TEM image of the central part of the bundle of parallel carbon chains of the length exceeding 40 nm. Gold NPs remained outside the frame of the image in this case. Our previous study showed that the ensemble of carbon chains in a bundle forms a kind of one-dimensional van der Waals crystal, where the distance between neighboring chains exceeds the interatomic distance in a single chain by a factor of 3.6. The kinks, indeed, have different locations.

## Low-Temperature PL Spectra of the Deposited Polyyne Chains

In the PL experiments, we excited the deposited polyyne chains quasiresonantly, at the wavelengths between 370 and 390 nm. The strong emission at the wavelengths over 400 nm has been detected. As there were necessarily thousands of individual carbon chains under our pump spot, which is of 2 μm size, the PL signal is always built from contributions of carbon chains of different lengths. The chains containing from 8 to 18 atoms typically dominate the spectra.

Figure 3a shows the characteristic PL spectra featuring broad resonances corresponding to the chains of different lengths emitting in the spectral range 2.4−3.0 eV. The lowest-energy optical transition shifts to the red with the increase of the length of the chain, in full agreement with the theoretical predictions. In Figure 3a we attribute the sequence of spectral resonances observed to the polyyne chains containing from 8 to 22 atoms (the transitions in chains of 8−18 atoms are labeled in the figure) in agreement with the previously reported transition energies and the results of our own ab initio calculation.

As temperature goes down to 4 K, a very distinct and peculiar fine structure emerges on the top of each broad PL peak (Figure 3b). Nearly identical triplet structures are observed for the chains of 10, 12, 14, and 16 atoms. A strong and very narrow peak with a full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of only 3−4 meV has two broader and lower satellites shifted by about 15 meV toward lower energies. This observation is in stark contrast with the exciton spectra of carbon nanotubes that typically feature strongly inhomogeneously broadened peaks with typical fwhm of several 10s meV.

The left panel of Figure 4 shows the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) data acquired at the high temperature (Figure 4a) and liquid helium temperature (Figure 4c). The TRPL is spectrally resolved, the selected bands being indicated in the insets. The high-temperature spectra show the double-exponential behavior reflecting the interplay between nonradiative (presumably, thermal hopping) and radiative channels of the exciton decay. The extracted decay times are plotted in Figure 4b. The low-temperature spectra show the monoexponential decay of the excitonic photoluminescence with a characteristic decay time of the order of 1 ns that is comparable with the typical radiative lifetimes of excitons in carbon nanotubes.

The exciton radiative lifetime increases with the increase of the length of the chain following the anticipated behavior of the matrix element of the dipole transition. We note that the exciton fine structure observed in CW PL spectra taken at the selective optical excitation cannot be resolved in the TRPL spectra as the pulsed excitation used in this spectroscopy technique is not wavelength selective. Still, the method allows for clearly distinguishing between the nonradiative exciton decay due to the thermal hopping of carriers and the exciton radiative recombination that dominates the low-temperature TRPL dynamics.

## Discussion

The triplet structures emerging as the temperature decreases are indicative of excitonic transitions. It is important to note that the textbook definition of the exciton binding energy as the difference of the transition energy for an electron−hole pair separated by an infinite distance and the exciton optical transition energy cannot be applied in our case, as electron and hole cannot be separated by more than a few nanometers in a van der Waals nanocrystal composed of a handful of carbon chains. The quantity that is relevant to our experimental observations is rather an exciton thermal dissociation energy. It characterizes the difference of the transition energies between an electron and a hole that belong to the same carbon chain and between an electron and a hole located in different (neighboring) carbon chains.

We conclude that the sum of integrated intensities of X− and X+ lines should be equal to or less than the integrated intensity of the X line. This is generally consistent with the data (see Figure 5d). The exciton dissociation into a radiatively inactive electron−hole pair by thermal hopping of one of the carriers to the neighboring chains (Figure 2c) is expected to govern the temperature dependence of the intensity of the observed excitonic peaks. From the PL spectra taken at temperatures between 4 and 300 K, we estimate the thermal hopping energy to be of the order of 15−20 meV. This is consistent with our variational calculation performed using the procedure developed in ref 32 for quantum wires.

Using the electron and hole effective masses predicted by our ab initio calculation as \( m_e = 0.078m_0 \) and \( m_h = 0.09m_0 \) with \( m_0 \) being a free electron mass, describing both dielectric and metallic screening by an effective dielectric constant \( \epsilon = 6 \) for spatially direct and \( \epsilon = 4 \) for spatially indirect excitons, we obtain the difference of large oscillator strength of the corresponding optical transitions. The similar plots obtained for C14 without gold terminations (see Figures S6 and S7 of the Supporting Information) lack these features, and the electronic density tends to vanish moving from the center to the ends of the chain.

We conclude that gold-stabilized carbon chains are highly advantageous for the observation of excitonic effects as they provide a very strong spatial localization, large oscillator strength, and low inhomogeneous broadening of the exciton and trion transitions.

In conclusion, we show that the sharp peaks emerging at low temperatures in the PL spectra of gold-stabilized carbon chains are indicative of the exciton and trion transitions based on the edge electronic states in the chains. The triplet fine structure that is very well seen at helium temperature is essentially independent of the length of the chain, while the absolute energies of the transitions become larger for the shorter chains. This observation demonstrates a high potentiality of synthesized polyyne chains for optoelectronic applications, especially in nanolasing and single photon emitters. Moreover, the observation of radiatively active excitons in ultimate one-dimensional carbon crystals is of great fundamental interest. Further studies are needed to fully reveal properties of excitons and trions in carbon chains.

## TABLE 2.1: Summary of Experimental Observations

| Parameter                     | Value                |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| Thermal Hopping Energy        | 15−20 meV            |
| Electron Effective Mass       | 0.078 m₀             |
| Hole Effective Mass           | 0.09 m₀              |
| Effective Dielectric Constant  | 6 (direct), 4 (indirect) |
| Exciton Binding Energy        | ~15 meV              |
| Trion Splitting               | 15 meV (positive), 25 meV (negative) |

----

The variational calculation predicts the exciton-positively charged trion splitting of about 15 meV and positive−negative trion splitting of 25 meV which is in good agreement with the data. The strong dipole polarization of approximately a half of gold-stabilized carbon chains is confirmed by their alignment in the external electric field (see the scheme in Figure 3a and the Supporting Information); thus, the presence of extra charges localized at the ends of some of the chains is beyond doubt.
