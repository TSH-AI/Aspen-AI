## Section 7.8: Detailed Analysis of Emission Properties

### 7.8.1 Emission Current vs. Diameter

The relationship between emission current and diameter is critical for understanding the performance of carbon nanotubes. As shown in Table 1, the emission current increases with decreasing diameter. This trend is significant for applications in nanoelectronics.

### 7.8.2 Work Function Variations

The work function of carbon nanotubes also varies with diameter. Smaller diameters tend to have lower work functions, which enhances their emission properties. This is illustrated in the following table:

| Diameter (nm) | Work Function (eV) |
|---------------|---------------------|
| 0.8           | 4.5                 |
| 1.0           | 4.6                 |
| 1.5           | 4.7                 |
| 2.0           | 4.8                 |

### 7.8.3 Implications for Device Design

Understanding these properties is essential for the design of devices utilizing carbon nanotubes. The ability to control emission properties through diameter adjustments can lead to more efficient electronic components.
