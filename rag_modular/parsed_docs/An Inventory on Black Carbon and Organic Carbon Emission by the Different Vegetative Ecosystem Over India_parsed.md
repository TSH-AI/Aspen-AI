Abstract
Fires provoke land degradation, deforestation, imbalance in the ecosystem, and promote changes in land
use. To add more vein aerosols such as Black Carbon (BC) and Organic Carbon (OC) were emitted during
the combustion event which plays a major role in climate change, pollution, and health. Hence this study
aims to estimate the emission, residence, dry deposition ux, and sequestering ability of deposited BC
and OC from different vegetative res across India using MODIS satellite data from 2013 to 2019. It was
observed that the mean OC and BC emission were about 5.08 × 107 tonnes 4.48 × 106 tonnes during the
re season across India. On a national scale, cropland res contributed the largest portion (80%) of total
carbonaceous aerosol emissions from open res. In co-emission of species, forest shares a maximum
relationship (> 92 percent) among carbonaceous aerosols. Estimation of deposition ux of emitted
species showed cropland has higher deposition rates with a residence period ranging between 7hours to
23days. From the observed results, it is evident that higher aerosol emission combined with negligible
deposition will be a potential threat to the environment. Waste utilization promoting strategies has to be
adopted in India since agriculture contributes to major aerosols emission.
Introduction
       Since the rise of vascular plants on the earth, res became a natural occurrence and a major threat
to the terrestrial ecosystem. In the earth system, re is an integral component, and it has a complex
relationship with climate and inuencing changes in the environmental attributes, particularly the carbon
cycle 1,2,3,4. Emission from a forest re is considered one of the major sources of air pollution, and these
emissions generate trace gases and aerosols that have both immediate and long-term effects on the
atmosphere5. The global carbon cycle receives potential feedback from terrestrial ecosystem res, and
carbonaceous aerosols such as black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) are found to be a major
portion of such wildre emissions6.
       BC is formed out of incomplete combustion. BC is a short-lived climate forcer considered second
only to carbon dioxide, forcing +1.1W/m2 7,8. In contrast, OC formed during gas to the particle conversion
process9 can also impact climate by forming cloud droplets by acting as cloud condensation nuclei and
by direct scattering of light10. The source of BC and OC is highly variable with time and space and is also
regionally dependent based on the region's characteristics11. Notably, these aerosols can play a vital role
in climate mitigation by serving as a long-term sink for carbon dioxide and cryosphere evolution when
deposited into the terrestrial carbon pool12.
       In Asia regions, the characterization of aerosol and Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions in the
environment and climate have been studied by conducting several international and national eld
experiments such as INDOEX13,14, ACE-Asia15, TRACE-P16, APEX17, and EAREX18. However, aerosol
deposition studies have not focused on these regions, even though vital in climate mitigation and policy-
making. The deposition is a complex process that depends on aerosol properties, land surface

## Results And Discussion

Aerosol deposition flux and lifetime studies are predominantly modeled. However, these studies show limited skill in simulating aerosols' spatial distribution, especially in mid to upper tropics. This has resulted in faster aging and a higher scavenging ratio by both dry and wet deposition in the Asian continent. The deposition of black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) occurs through wet or dry deposition mechanisms into terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems, which is known as a sink.

A carbon sink is an important factor in global climatic negotiations, as markets for carbon trading have been adopted since the Kyoto Protocol. Globally, the land ecosystem dominates the anthropogenic sink of carbon by 30%, followed by the ocean accounting for 25%, while the remaining particles and gases stay in the atmosphere. Carbon stock (drawn down carbon) varies across forest types, with tropical forests accounting for a stock of 303 tonnes of carbon per hectare, followed by temperate (66 ton/ha) and boreal forests (44 ton/ha). However, to date, quantification of the tropical land sink and sources has not been spatially and temporally explicit. The carbon stock of Indian forests is 6941 million tonnes as of 2011.

Estimating the burned area is essential in quantifying the impact of emissions on climate-carbon cycle feedback, especially during the climate emergency era of the twenty-first century. Historically, burned area information has been based on ground estimates of fires reported by fire management teams. Countries' methods to calculate emissions are based on data collected, which have been unreliable on global and continental scales. Unearthing the burned area through satellite observation has served as a better alternative to older techniques, especially since satellite-based observation began in 1974. Fire emission estimates have been continuously progressing since then, and the values used were best-guessed values of average annual area burned, the efficiency of burning, and biome density.

India has been adopting strategies to increase the carbon sink by approximately three billion tonnes to combat climate change because the annual mean temperature is projected to rise by 2.5°C to 4°C in India by the end of the century. However, a lack of knowledge prevails in understanding the long-term and inter-annual interaction between fire and carbon flux, as the effects of altered fire regimes on soil carbon, nutrient storage, or limited plant productivity exist. The potential for utilizing satellite-based observation to overcome these aspects is widely recognized. Based on our literature, for the first time across India, this study addresses the deposition flux and residence time of carbonaceous aerosol. Hence, this study aims to address the following objectives:

1. To address fire trends across different land cover types and major contributors to the highest vegetation fire concentration.
2. To estimate carbon stock in burned land cover across the study region.
3. To understand the deposition flux of biomass burning aerosol during the study period.

These results help us understand fire management, carbon dynamics, climate mitigation, and other related issues.

## BC and OC Emission of Different Vegetative Types

The aerosols emitted during the fire event are majorly composed of BC and OC. Emission of BC and OC from different vegetation types is studied from the year 2013-2019, respectively.

The emission scenario of different plant cover types is shown in Supplementary Fig. (1). From this figure, we observe that the major components burned in fires are croplands (agricultural and natural crops), which share 80% of the total emission. Forests follow with a share of 3-14% of the total burned area, contributing to aerosol emissions. While shrubland involves emissions from burning, which is not significant and shows a shrinking trend from 2017 to 2019. The major contribution of cropland to the overall burned area is that India is one of the largest producing countries globally, and this is evident with its agricultural fires accounting for 43–57% of all cropland fires. A study on the greenhouse gas inventory in Thailand also indicated similar results of more than 80% of emissions by the agricultural sector. The decrease in forest fire contribution may be due to land clearing for collecting Mahua (Madhuca Indica) flowers and the shifting cultivation by the tribal community, which accounts for 23% of annual deforestation in India.

### Cropland Ecosystem

Cropland emission of BC ranges from 5.16×10³ kg/year to 15.26×10¹⁵ kg/year. The mean BC emission in the cropland ecosystem is found to be:

- 2.19×10⁶ kg (2013)
- 1.31×10¹⁴ kg (2014)
- 1.01×10⁶ kg (2015)
- 1.7×10⁶ kg (2016)
- 9.66×10¹² kg (2017)
- 1.7×10⁶ kg (2018)
- 1.5×10⁶ kg (2019)

While OC emission varies as:

- 2.56×10⁷ kg (2013)
- 1.53×10¹⁵ kg (2014)
- 1.02×10⁷ kg (2015)
- 1.98×10⁷ kg (2016)
- 1.03×10¹³ kg (2017)
- 1.13×10⁷ kg (2018)
- 1.75×10⁷ kg (2019)

The observed variations show that a peak BC concentration is found during 2014 (5.09 ×10¹⁰ kg), and the lowest BC concentration is observed in the year 2018 with an emission of 3.52 kg. Similarly, mean OC ranges from 9.03×10⁷ kg to a maximum of 1.3×10¹⁵ kg (2014). The reason for the highest recorded BC and OC emission is due to the dry fires and the meteorological condition with an annually-averaged temperature hike (0.69°C), making 2014 the warmest year since 1888. Land under cultivation must be considered for reducing emission during 2015 and 2018 as 1.5% and 2% of the land areas under cultivation were reduced in 2015 and 2018, respectively. This may be caused due to a reduction in rainfall, leading to crop loss during agricultural seasons. A similar satellite study conducted between 1950-2015 across Asia has estimated mean BC (3.89 Tg) and OC (6.92 Tg), which vary by a factor of ten to the power of five compared to our results. The relationship between BC and OC emission is studied using multiple regression analysis. The regression coefficient (R²) returns a value of fifteen percent showing a lesser significant contribution by OC towards BC emission, which is a characteristic of residential biofuels and agricultural burning. ANOVA test was carried out to verify the significance of the difference between groups. In the cropland ecosystem, there was a statistically significant difference between the groups of BC and OC groups during the study period as determined by one-way ANOVA (F (6, 14615) = 79.702, p = 0.001). The emission trend of mean BC and OC in the cropland ecosystem is shown in Fig. 1.

## Forest Ecosystem

BC emission ranges from 2.16 × 10^7 kg to 2.9 × 10^9 kg, and OC is from 1.86 × 10^8 kg to 2.5 × 10^10 kg during the emission events in the study period. The mean BC emission in forests is increasing consistently with each year from 2.16 × 10^7 kg (2013) to 2.9 × 10^9 kg (2019), respectively. While mean OC emission is found to be 1.31 × 10^10 kg with a high concentration of 2.5 × 10^10 kg (2019) and minimum concentration in 1.86 × 10^8 kg (2013), respectively. Forest cover is observed to decline from 2013 (1.83%) to 2015 (1.2%), which serves as a major reason for the decline in related emissions. Fire incidents in the forests tended to increase during 2015-2019 due to low priority in managing anthropogenic fires as funds to be spent on fires are reduced. As per the Indian State of Forest Report, the major contributors to a forest during our study period were people who indulge in clearing activities for purposes like cultivation, non-timber forest produce collection, and hunting/poaching purposes. The annual average aerosol emission from forest fires in China was 2.7 Gg, and 27.4 Gg for BC and OC is significantly less than our dry seasonal average emissions. In a continental context, a satellite study put forward the emission of BC (2.3 × 10^7 kg/year) and OC (2.3 × 10^7 kg/year) from open non-agricultural fires, which is significantly less than our obtained results of BC (4.16 × 10^8 kg/year) and OC (4.84 × 10^9 kg/year) respectively. The emission returns a significant relationship between the organic and BC with a regression coefficient of R² = 0.92, p < 0.01. It suggests that the co-emission ratio of OC and BC is high in India's forests. Further, the mean annual OC (1.31 × 10^9 kg) is found to be higher than BC (1.50 × 10^8 kg), and this ratio is a general characteristic of forest emission. A study ANOVA test was carried out to verify the significance of the difference between groups and in the forest ecosystem there was a statistically significant difference in the emission of BC and OC observed during the study period as determined by one-way ANOVA (F (6, 1499) = 149.026, p = 0.001). The emission trend of mean BC and OC in a forest ecosystem is shown in Fig. 2.

## Shrubland Ecosystem

Emission of mean BC shows a high spike during the emission events in the year 2014 (3.02 × 10^9 kg) and 2017 (2.07 × 10^7 kg) and then attains a lower bound emission in 2013 (1.2 × 10^4 kg) and 2015 (1.28 × 10^4 kg). While OC ranges from 2.8 × 10^8 kg to 8.62 × 10^4 kg with upper peak emission in 2017 (1.17 × 10^8 kg) and bottom peak in 2019 (8.62 × 10^4 kg) during the dry season in 2013-2019, respectively. A similar inventory study on shrubland emission using a smaller grid satellite data observed BC (19.4 × 10^3 kg) and OC (13.76 × 10^5 kg) as their annual emissions, which are found to be ten times lesser than our emissions. The mean BC and OC emission have a healthy relationship of seventeen percent at a confidence level of 95 percent. We hypothesize that due to much lesser natural fires and a lack of human intervention in forest bush fires during the dry season in the study period. ANOVA test was carried out to verify the significance of the difference between groups and in the shrubland ecosystem. There was a statistically significant difference between the emission of BC and OC during the study period as determined by one-way ANOVA (F (6, 1499) = 24.501, p = 0.001). The emission trend of mean BC...

A satellite-based global estimated value for Southeast Asia was 5.14×10²⁰ kg/year (BC) and 5.3×10²¹ kg/year (OC), respectively. While our results show 3.04×10¹⁰ kg/year (BC) and 3.53×10¹¹ kg/year (OC), which is ten times less than the estimates as it covers the entire region of Southeast Asia, but in individual terms, it offers a significant contribution.

## A regional analysis of emissions

### A Geospatial analysis

The spatial analysis of OC and BC emission in kilograms during 2013-2019 is done using the Geographical Information System (GIS), which is presented as Fig. 4 and 5. The emission is segregated into grids, with each grid covering 27.75 km across the country. The emission is segregated into low (1.09-2.6), medium (2.69-6.11), maximum (greater than 71.2), and no emission (0-1.9). The estimated mean BC and OC emission for India from total biomass burning is around 1.98×10⁷ kg and 1.59×10⁸ kg for the base year 2013. A significant increase in species emission is observed in the advancing years with 5.73×10¹³ kg of BC and then 3.06×10¹⁴ kg of OC until 2017, which then showed a declining trend. Since 2016, stringent enforcement of a ban on stubble burning by the government made major agricultural regions reduce its stubble count, leading to a reduction in emission, which is estimated based on a satellite study by NASA.

Region-wise analysis of BC and OC emission by different vegetation types is presented in Supplementary Table 1. Overall state-wise analysis of BC and OC indicates that Andhra Pradesh has the maximum amount of emission, followed by Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, and Kerala. Cropland fires are high in states like Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh. These regions are cultivating six major crops produced in India. The states that accounted for the high cropland emission are the states with high population density and hold the most fertile land for agriculture. Forests share the next major emission of BC and OC in India with the increasing wildfires during the dry season every year. Manipur, Meghalaya, Uttarkhand, and Tripura share maximum emissions during the study period. These regions come under moist deciduous forest types that are subjected to frequent fires. Uttarkhand is the youngest mountain region of the Himalayas, mainly experiencing annual forest fires, which have worsened during our study period, especially in the year 2016. In a study, the highest concentration of emerging intensified fire hotspots is found in northeast and central India, which is substantiated by our results. Shrubland fires are frequently observed in the regions of Telangana, Himachal, Jammu & Kashmir, Bihar, and Tamil Nadu. Further, megacities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, and Kolkata are also observed to have higher emissions of OC and BC, which is due to the industrial and high vehicular emissions.

## Carbon Emissions and Sequestration

BC and OC concentration during biomass burning events for 2013-2019 are displayed in Supplementary Fig. 2 and 3. Similarly, BC's emission is studied during India’s fire season, i.e., January to June, shown in Supplementary Fig. 4 and 5. The highest BC emission is observed in March with 5.37×10^6 kg (2018), followed by 4.91×10^6 kg (2016). For April, it is pointed at 4.30×10^4 kg (2014) and 4.80×10^6 kg (2017). While May records emissions of 1.94×10^6 kg (2016), 6.51×10^5 kg (2017), and 5.77×10^5 kg (2018), respectively. Similarly, OC records 2.68×10^7 kg to 1.93×10^7 kg between 2018 and 2014, respectively. For April, the mean OC emission ranges from 6.55×10^4 kg to 2.56×10^7 kg (2014 and 2017), and then it hikes to 9.64×10^6 kg (2016) and 1.84×10^5 kg (2017) in May. Overall, the carbonaceous aerosol emission is high from March to May, especially with higher fire events between 2014 and 2017. As per the India State of Forest Report, India experienced a jump in forest fires by 125% during 2014-2017 in which most of them are non-dense forest areas. This pattern can be explained by the seasons of India. For forest regions, deciduous trees shed their leaves in January, which primes to add fuel load availability to the prevailing dry weather fires. A subside in emission is observed in June, which may be attributed to the onset of monsoon season as soil moisture increases due to rainfall. The results in reducing wood-burning capacity by absorbing moisture in the woods. However, for cropland fires, observed temporal variation of carbonaceous aerosol emission indicates that the emission is high during March (56%) to May (28%) for the entire study period, which is a stubble burning season in India, especially in northern parts of the country.

### Carbon Sequestration

The estimated carbon sequestration in cropland was found to be highest at 8.23×10^13 tonnes of carbon per hectare in 2019 with the leakage in 2015 (-4.21 × 10^11 t/ha) and 2017 (-1.54 × 10^12 t/ha). Intensification of the crop in agriculture may result in loss of carbon stock in agricultural lands as the land area was reduced approximately two percent from 2015 to 2017. A modelling study also estimated the loss of carbon stock due to land-use intensification or agricultural land change. Agricultural activities such as fertilizer and manure addition contribute to the replenishment of carbon stock, favouring sequestration and long-term storage of OC in the cropland ecosystem during our study period. While in forest carbon sink is observed to be 4.10 × 10^10 t/ha (2013), 9.18 × 10^10 t/ha (2014), -8.10 × 10^10 t/ha (2015), 1.77 × 10^11 t/ha (2016), -5.60 × 10^10 t/ha (2017), and 2.88 × 10^10 t/ha (2018), -5.96 × 10^10 t/ha (2019). In the Indian forest ecosystem, the carbon stock is found to be reduced after 2017, which is due to drought experienced for three consecutive years in major forest regions. Besides, a reduction in dense forest cover of over 20,000 hectares, which is diverted for mining, thermal power projects, and wildfires, also serves as a major causative agent for the reduction in carbon stock after 2015. Similarly, in shrubland ecosystem carbon sink is found to increase consistently from 2013 (4.89 × 10^10 t/ha), 2014 (1.06 × 10^10 t/ha), 2016 (2.15 × 10^11 t/ha) and 2018 (2.76 × 10^11 t/ha) with leakage in 2015 (-1.47 × 10^11 t/ha), 2017 (-2.78 × 10^11 t/ha) and 2019 (-1.01 × 10^11 t/ha) respectively. Grasslands stock lays majorly on above-ground biomass, which dips down mainly because of fire, poor management, deforestation (direct effect), and shifting agriculture (indirect effect).

## Carbon Sequestration and Deposition Flux

Shrublands are lost in a decade by reforestation, deforestation, and fodder production as demand for feeding livestock has grown by 65%. Besides these, more than eighty percent of India's shrubland is in the poor range class that it is easily affected by weather and soil erosion. The carbon sink of different biomes is represented in supplementary Fig. 6. Carbon sequestration of the burned area accounts for enhancing or degrading the carbon deposits of a region. The estimated current annual carbon stock (CACS) varied between different ecosystems, plotted in Supplementary Table 2. Cropland deposits of carbon decrease consistently from the base year 2013 until 2015 and then the stock seems to improve gradually until 2019 from 1.25×10¹¹ t of C per hectare to 1.13×10¹³ t of C per hectare. Similarly, in the shrubland ecosystem, carbon stock increased from 6.70×10⁹ t C/ha to 3.78×10¹¹ t of C/ha until 2018 and then reduced to 137% in 2019. A higher variability is observed in forest ecosystem carbon stock reduced from 5.29×10⁹ t of C per hectare to -8.16×10¹⁰ t of C per hectare during 2013-2019. The total mean carbon stock of the vegetative ecosystem increased from 48% to 234% during 2013-2019, with dips in 2014-2015 (236%) and 2016-2017 (244%). Overall, the average carbon sink variability differs from yearly in our study, which agrees with a global study conducted in the terrestrial ecosystem using models.

### Deposition Flux of BC and OC

The size and properties of the BC particles determine the residence time and deposition flux. The deposition flux of BC particles is estimated for different land cover emissions and is calculated with a range of upper and lower limits. The estimated lower limit means deposition flux was observed to be highest in the cropland ecosystem with 0.47 kg of BC deposited per kilometre and 11.9 kg/km (OC) in a day for an atmospheric mean concentration of 5.85 ×10¹⁰ kg. While upper limit extends to 0.55 kg/km/day (BC) and 11.9 kg/km/day (OC). Interestingly, minimum means deposition flux is observed in shrublands for an average BC concentration (1.11×10⁵ kg/km/day) and OC concentration (6.28×10⁶ kg/km/day), which has a mean flux of 1.04×10⁻⁶ kg/km/day for BC, OC has 5.86×10⁻⁶ kg/km/day as the lower limit and 1.93×10⁻⁵ (BC) and 1.09 ×10⁻⁴ kg/km/day (OC) as the upper limit. Dry deposition flux is most suitable for particles having a higher aerodynamic size (<2.5μm), and the washout mechanism majorly removes sub-micron particles. The dry deposition value of small micron particles in the range of 0-2.5 and 1-2.5μm was 35±3% and 21%. The BC and OC coarse particles are not considered.

Mean fluxes of BC deposition for seven years from 2013-2019 were 2.77×10¹ Tg/year (BC) and 1.57×10² Tg/year (OC) for shrubland, 9.1×10¹ Tg/year (BC) and 1.41×10³ Tg/year (OC) for the forest, and 1.41×10⁶ Tg/year (BC) and 3.1×10⁷ Tg/year (OC) for cropland ecosystem respectively. Overall, the mean deposition flux of BC and OC decreases with years with an exception in 2014. As our study is carried out during the summer season, where the low frequency of rainfall is observed leading to lesser deposition of carbonaceous aerosols and such a declining trend in dry deposition rate is observed across the globe. Global annually averaged dry deposited BC-based on model experiments vary from 0.66 to 1.66 Tg/year, which significantly differs with a ratio of 17.3:1 for shrubland, 56.8:1 for the forest more than a percent difference in cropland. This large variation may be attributed because discrepancies exist in modelling the submicron particles.

Aerosol particles may have individual varying residence time, and it fluctuates with space and time. BC's mean residence time constantly stood for the study period with 0.7 days for upper estimates in the cropland ecosystem while lower estimates fluctuated between 0.1 day (4.4×10³ kg/km/day) to 23 days (6.4×10³ kg/km/day). However, shrubland and forest ecosystem emitted aerosols had a similar mean atmospheric residence time of 8.6 days. Deposition flux of BC over grassland and shrubland is estimated to be between 7-11 days, which best fits our results. However, the global BC residence time is 7.85 days, which is very much less than our prediction. The deposition flux of BC and OC is presented in Tables 1 and 2.

## Conclusion

In this study, a high spatiotemporal resolution (monthly data in a 0.25º by 0.25º grid) emissions inventory was developed from biomass burning across India based on Fire CCI burned area data for a period of seven years from 2013-2019. The annual average emission of BC and OC emission from the different vegetative systems were assessed. Cropland contributes 1.34×10¹³ kg and 1.52×10¹⁴ kg as annual mean black and OC emission concentrated in central, north-western, and IGP of India. Forests share a significant emission of mean OC (1.3×10¹⁰ kg) and mean BC (1.52×10⁹ kg) in Manipur, Meghalaya, Uttarakhand, and Tripura regions. In contrast, shrublands in hilly regions of the north and southern India are the least contributors with 1.69×10⁸ kg and 9.52×10⁸ kg of mean black and OC emission respectively. On a national scale, cropland fires contributed the largest portion (80%) of total carbonaceous aerosol emissions from open fires. Forest fires and shrubland fires ranked second and third places, accounting for 14% and 6%, respectively. Individual crop contribution towards agricultural emission is assessed in which wheat serves as a prime contributor with a share of almost ninety percent of total agricultural emission. The co-emission of species, forest shares a maximum BC and OC emission with a relationship greater than 92%. Temporally maximum total aerosol emission is observed in 2014 and a minimum in 2018 with the frequent re-events. The monthly variation of black and OC emission had its peak from March to May of the dry season. The resultant means dry deposition fluxes of BC and OC emission for seven years from 2013-2019 were 1.01×10⁻⁵ kg/km/day and 5.74×10⁻⁵ kg/km/day for shrubland, similarly, 3.32×10⁻⁵ kg/km/day and 5.13×10⁻⁴ kg/km/day for forest, and 5.14×10⁻¹ kg/km/day and 11 kg/km/day for cropland ecosystem respectively. The average residence/lifetime of BC emitted from other vegetative ecosystem fires is between 8.6 and 11.6 days. The above estimations were performed by employing appropriate emission factors for carbonaceous aerosols, which are in good agreement with the previous emission inventory studies conducted in India shown in Table 2. Human activities are the major cause of fires in the study region, coupled with natural events like lightning, climate-induced change, and meteorology. Therefore, OC and BC emissions must be mitigated by proper management of anthropogenic interventions leading to wildfire in forests and proper administration of land use, especially in croplands that cover most of India's land as it will lead to land degradation and erosion.

This work-integrated many different datasets and formulae to estimate the emission of carbonaceous aerosols from wildfires and their carbon dynamics. First, appropriate emission factors were employed to calculate the emission from satellite observations, which may suffer limitations as it is not based on real-time activity data and uncertainties in India's monitoring of fires prevail. However, the factors used were in good agreement with the previous studies conducted in India. Earlier emission inventories studies in India are presented in Table 2. Carbon stock and sink of the burned area are also estimated which are not a representation of the individual species, region, or type of fire. Further, estimated carbonaceous aerosol deposition is unlikely to contribute to the carbon stock especially in immediate years. This is a new learning process, conducted in terms of biomass emissions-based lifetime and deposition of particles across India. In general, the deposition velocity of the particle varies with space and time. Hence, we recommend carrying out continuous in-situ measurement of BC concentration and find out representative deposition velocity for that region, which will help reduce the limiting factors in radiative forcing and climate change studies. This study also recommends carrying out activity-based emission inventories across India to reduce the uncertainties in estimating carbonaceous aerosol emission.

## Materials And Methods

### Study area
India is a subcontinent covering a diversity of terrestrial ecosystems. It is located between 8°4', 37°6'N latitudes and 68°7', 97°25'E longitude. One of the rich biodiversity hotspots and the seventh-largest country in the world with a land area of 12 lakh square miles (3,286,592 Km²). It has the highest mountains in the north, the Thar desert to its west, the Gangetic delta to its east, and the Deccan plateau (agro-ecological diversity) to the south. It experiences drastic land-use changes, climate, topography, flora (11%), fauna (6.5%), and socio-economic conditions due to the ever-increasing population. Because of the progressive increase in India's population to 1.27 billion, it has a decadal growth rate of 17.70%. The increase in population facilitates food demand, making 70% of rural livelihoods depend solely on agriculture. It holds 86 million hectares of agricultural land which is rain-fed and ranks to be one of the top countries in terms of agricultural production. Besides that, India has potential forest resources covering 70.6 million hectares occupying an area of one-fifth of the territory in India with 173,000 villages depending on forest resources for their livelihood.

### Data
In this study, burned area product from Fire_CCI v5.1 (MOD09GQ) Collection 6 Images of 250 m spatial resolution was used to define the burned area in India from 2013-2019. Gridded Fire_CCI v5.1 data is generated from the red and near-infrared reflectance and thermal anomaly information of the MODIS (Moderate Imaging Spectro-radiometer) sensor with the resolution of 0.25° by 0.25°. The dataset includes a fraction of burnable area, vegetation name, latitude, longitude, and the number of patches. This study analyzed the monthly burned area and the fraction of burnable area data for seven...

## Methodology

Estimating the burned area of different biomes is typically calculated from the combustion efficiency, fuel load, and a fraction of biomass burned along with appropriate emission factors. The satellite data of the burned area of forest, shrubland, and croplands are considered to estimate the emissions of land cover types during the study period from 2013-2019. Parameters used to find species' emissions involve a fraction of burnable area, vegetation name, latitude, longitude, vegetation indices, and land cover class. The most used bottom-up inventory equation prescribed by is employed to calculate the emissions.

### Burned biomass (Bb) Calculation

Burned biomass (Bb) is calculated using the following equation:

\[
Bb = A \times B \times \beta \times EF \times 10^{-3}
\]

Where:
- Bb is the biomass consumption amount (kg);
- A is the burned area measure (m²);
- B is the biomass amount inside the burned area (kg m⁻²);
- β is the combustion efficiency or the fraction of fuel that burned;
- EF is an emission factor of species (g/kg).

An emission factor is a representative value that attempts to relate the quantity of a pollutant released into the atmosphere with an activity associated with the release of that pollutant. In this study, each land-cover type's emission factors were obtained from a publication, which has an integrated emission factor data of 370 published studies. Emission factor values used in this study were:
- 3 (OC), 0.53 (BC) for Shrublands and grasslands,
- 4.4 (OC), 0.51 (BC) for Forests,
- 4.9 (OC) and 0.42 (BC) for agricultural fires, given in grams of species per kilogram of dry matter burned.

### Estimation of Carbon Sequestration and BC Flux

Soil OC (SOC) pool of the burned area can be derived from estimating the soil's OC content to a depth of 30 cm or by calculating above and below ground mass carbon stocks. The summation of carbon...

## Carbon Stock Calculation

The carbon stock in different segments gives us the total carbon pool of each land-use type of region. A typical carbon stock for a specific region and land use can be derived by multiplying the carbon stock per unit area (t/ha) with the total area covered by specific land use. In our case, we used the reference stock of tropical dry area (38 t C ha⁻¹) which is derived from mean estimates of different studies by IPCC.

### Carbon Pool Calculation
\[ \text{Carbon pool} = \text{SOC}_{\text{ref}} \times \text{FLU} \times \text{BA} \]  - (2)

Where:
- SOCref = Default value of soil OC (carbon in tonnes)
- FLU = Stock change factor of a specific land-use pattern (dimensionless)
- BA = Burned Area (in hectares).

As Indian agriculture is mainly composed of loamy alluvial soil, we used the default value of tropical agricultural land-use factor and shrublands tropical default value for long-term standing factors. For an annual change in the carbon, the stock change method was assessed as per IPCC guidelines.

### Change in Carbon Stock
\[ \text{CACS} = \text{Carbon stock (n)} - \text{Carbon stock (n-1)} \]  - (3)

### Carbon Sequestration
\[ \text{Carbon sequestration} = \text{CACS} \times \frac{44}{6} \]  - (4)

Where:
- CACS = Change in Annual Carbon Stock
- Carbon stock (n) = Carbon stock at the current year
- Carbon stock (n-1) = Carbon stock in the previous year.

## Deposition Flux and Residence Time

The dry deposition flux of atmospheric BC was estimated by multiplying the BC concentration and dry deposition velocity.

\[ \text{Flux} = C \times V_d \]  - (5)

Where:
- C is the atmospheric BC concentration (kg/km²)
- Vd is the dry deposition velocity.

The dry deposition velocity is obtained by summation of the inverse of atmospheric aerodynamic, quasi-laminar sublayer, and surface or canopy resistance. A lower and upper estimate for forest and grasslands is selected for this study, which is \( 7 \times 10^{-7} \) and \( 1.5 \times 10^{-5} \) kilometers per second respectively. These values were derived from global modeled studies, and some uncertainties exist by an order of two magnitudes due to particle size and microclimatic conditions. These values were derived with certain assumptions for grassland and forest deposition which is found in a study by Pryor and reference cited therein. The settling velocity is generally higher than \( 1.5 \times 10^{-5} \) km/s in the terrestrial ecosystem, and hence it is considered as a lower bound in-residence time estimation.

## 第 13 部分

The residence time of an aerosol species can be obtained from the ratio of aerosol concentration or load to the total load of the species by its removal rates. The satellite-derived aerosols were considered as atmospheric load in the calculation.

τ = L / (Rdd + Rwd + Rgs)                                    - (6)

Where
- τ = Residence time in days
- L = Aerosol load in Kg/km²
- R = Removal rates in Kg/km²/days.
