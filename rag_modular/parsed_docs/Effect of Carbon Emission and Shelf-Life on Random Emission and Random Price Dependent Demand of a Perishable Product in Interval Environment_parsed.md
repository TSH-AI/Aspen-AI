## Abstract
An inventory of suppliers dealing with supply of raw materials from the natural resources like sugarcane, beetroot, vegetable scraps etc. need to choose the product for supply to the production industries with a great consciousness due to their finite shelf-life and carbon emission property. A product with small shelf-life and carrying the burden of carbon tax need to be sold quickly so that overall profit earn can be maximize in such a situation. Further the situation deteriorates when the selling price of a product is affected by the carbon emission and its absolute value reduces with time. There we need a formal mathematical design that can include all these issues of price and carbon tax so that the supplier can select the best product for sale. In this paper we develop and inventory model to investigate the earnings made by the supplier, selling the product with price- and stock- dependent demand and study the effect of carbon emission and shelf-life. Further we obtain the optimal preservation cost and green investment to reduce the deterioration and carbon emission. We study the model under different cases; deterministic demand, probabilistic demand with random emission and probabilistic demand with random price. We perform the sensitivity analysis.

## 1. Introduction
In the production industries of sugar and ethanol, the use of natural resources as a raw material is a common practice. However, exploiting natural resources like sugarcane, Woodstock, vegetable scrap etc. can increase the risk of carbon emission in the environment due to fast rate of deterioration. Further, over utilization of natural resources can cause natural disasters and therefore a controlled supply of these products to the production industries is important in order to earn a good profit and simultaneously minimizing the carbon tax. Apart from carbon emission, the products stated above have a small shelf-life so the supplier must sell the product as early as possible. Incorporation and exploitation of green technologies and modern preservation techniques can reduce both carbon tax and deterioration cost. Inventory modelling is an active area of research since decades. Recently the research work on the application and analysis of carbon footprints and its effect on the demand of a product is an interesting topic for the researchers. Saha et al. (2021) proposed a supply chain model to study the competition on green products retailing. A study on green policies is proposed by Dutta et al. (2019). Ritha and Poongidisathiya (2018) proposed a green inventory model to minimize the total cost of the system and optimize the ordering quantity of the carbon sensitive products under green policies. Hovelaque and Bironneau (2015) proposed an EOQ model with emission dependent demand and carbon constraint. De-la-Cruz-Marquez et al. (2021) propose an inventory model with price dependent demand and considering carbon emission with imperfect quality. For more research on EOQ inventory model under carbon emission we refer Christata and Daryanto (2020). Dutta (2017) made an extensive research on effect of green investment on production inventory with carbon emission under bounded production limit; the research illustrates that carbon emission cost has a positive effect on...

## Description of Problem

In demand and supply chain of perishable raw materials to produce biofuel, ethanol, sugar, paper etc. the vendor faces two major problems related to deterioration and carbon emission. A perishable product has a short shelf-life and must be distributed before the sell-by period. Further, the production industries prefer the raw materials whose rate of carbon emission is low; therefore, the demand for the raw materials depends on both shelf-life and rate of carbon emission. In our present paper, we made an attempt to develop an inventory model to study the effect of shelf-life and carbon emission on the demand of the product. The different cases that we study under the given inventory model are as follows:
- a) To analyse the profit earned under random emission.
- b) To analyse the profit earned under probabilistic selling price.
- c) To analyse the profit under variable shelf-life and rate of carbon emission.
- d) To analyse the profit under different patterns of carbon emission.

## Methodology

In order to solve the model for optimization, first we convert the profit function from crisp environment to interval environment. Then we solve the model in interval environment using three forms of particle swarm optimization algorithm, that is, Weighted PSO, Constriction PSO, and Quantum PSO, and the solution is accepted after statistical verification. We employ linear differential equations to develop the inventory model. We perform sensitivity analysis of the parameters.

The differential equation representing the flow of material from the stock to the market is given by:

\[
\frac{dI}{dt} + \theta(\beta, \gamma)I = R - D(t, p, \gamma)
\]

Subject to the condition \(I(0) = I_0\).

The inventory level at any time \(t\) is given by:

\[
I(t) = I_0 e^{-t(\theta(\beta, \gamma) + \rho(\gamma))} + \frac{(RK + \alpha \rho^2(\gamma) - d \rho(\gamma) K - \alpha \rho^2(\gamma))(1 - e^{-(\theta(\beta, \gamma) + \rho(\gamma))t})}{K(\theta(\beta, \gamma) + \rho(\gamma))} + \frac{\tau K(\theta(\beta, \gamma) + \rho(\gamma))^2}{\alpha \rho^2(\gamma) t}

## Solution Procedure

1. The objective function in the interval environment consists of two parts \( A_P L \) and \( A_P R \). We consider these two functions as two different objective functions.
2. Let \( \mathbf{y} \) be the decision variable and \( \sigma \) be the variable representing the weight for the objective function.
3. We define the objective functions as:
\[
F(y, \sigma) = \sigma A_P L(y) + (1 - \sigma) A_P R(y)
\]
4. The decision variable \( y \) must satisfy the constraint \( A_P < A_P \)
\[
R < L
\]
5. We run the algorithm to maximize \( F(y, 0.5) \) and obtain the optimal value \( y^* \) such that
\[
A_P (y^*) < A_P (y^*)
\]
\[
L < R
\]

## 8.1 Genetic Algorithm

In genetic algorithm, Yang (2015), we basically perform four steps to optimize a function these steps are defined as follows;

- **Selection:** In selection process we select population of finite size randomly from the search boundary. There are various methods of selecting the population; Enlisted selection, Roulette Wheel, Tournament Selection, Rank Selection, Boltzmann Selection etc. In our case we have performed elitist selection method to choose our population.

- **Crossover:** The crossover operation is usually depending on the problem to optimize. Due to the continuous objective function of real decision variables we consider the convex combination of two chromosomes.

- **Mutation:** The purpose of mutation operation is to retard the rate of convergence. The probability of mutation is usually small and included in the algorithm to protect the evolution of solution from being trapped in local optimum. In our GA coding we consider the mutation operation as a minute change in the decision variable.

- **Stopping Criteria:** In this step we provide some valid condition to terminate the iteration process. There are many stopping criteria available although in our GA coding we terminate the algorithm after a certain number of iteration and accept the solution if the variance of the set of global optima is less than \(10^{-5}\).

### Procedure of Genetic Algorithm

The individuals are selected for crossover on the basis of fitness probability of each individual and the crossover probability. A set of individuals are selected by elitist selection method. We define crossover probability and mutation probability. Whenever the fitness probability is more than the crossover probability we select the individual for crossover. Similarly, if the fitness probability is less than the mutation probability then we apply the mutation operation on that individual. We repeat the steps until we get a set of global optima in the given search boundary whose variance is less than \(10^{-5}\).

To perform the soft computing, we assume the following values of the parameters of GA.

- Population Size \(N = 100\)
- Crossover Probability \(c = 0.5\)
- Mutation Probability \(m = 0.1\)
- Maximum Iteration \(Gen = 3000\)

## 8.2 WPSO Algorithm

In weighted PSO we attach a weight to the initial velocity of the particle. This weight is often termed as inertial weight which is defined as constant and the value usually ranges between [0.5, 0.9] Eberhart & Shi (2000) and Yang, (2015).

\[
w = w_{max} - \frac{w_{min}}{N}
\]

Where, \(N\) is maximum number of iteration, \(w_{max}\) is maximum inertial weight, \(w_{min}\) is minimum inertial weight and \(i\) is the iteration number.

| 1    | Initialized the population of size \( M \) |
| 2    | Compute fitness of objective function for each particle |
| 3    | Initially set \( x^* = x^* = \) particle with maximum fitness \( p \) |
| 4    | While \( n < Max\_run \) |
| 5    | While \( iter < N \) |
| 6    | \( w = w_{max} - w_{min} \cdot i \) |
| 7    | For \( i \in \{1,2,3, \ldots, M\} \) |
| 8    | For \( j \in \{1,2,3, \ldots, N\} \) |
| 9    | \( u_i = w \cdot u_i + pr(x^* - x_i) + qs(x^* - x_i) \) |
| 10   | \( x_i = x_i + u_i \) |
| 11   | End loop |

| 13   | Compute the fitness of objective function for each particle at \( j + 1 \) |
| 14   | Obtain the maximum fitness and assign it to \( x^* \) |

| 16   | End iteration |
| 17   | Update \( x^* \) |
| 18   | \( n = n + 1 \) |
| 19   | End run |

We assume the following values of the parameters of WPSO:
- Population Size \( N = 100 \)
- Number of Run \( MaxRun = 20 \)
- Number of Iteration \( MaxItr = 500 \)
- Minimum Inertial Weight \( w_{min} = 0.4 \)
- Maximum Inertial Weight \( w_{max} = 0.9 \)
- Acceleration Coefficients \( c_1 = 2.4 \) and \( c_2 = 2 \)

### 8.3 CPSO Algorithm

In CPSO we assign a constant weight to the velocity equation (Eberhart and Shi, 2000). It is an effective measure to control the motion of search particles in the swarm and helps in optimum search of the search boundary. Let \( p_i \) be the \( i^{th} \) particle at \( j^{th} \) position with initial velocity \( v_i \).

Then the velocity equation together with constriction factor \( \delta \) for the \( (j + 1)^{th} \) position is given by:
\[
v_i = \delta[v_i + a_g(p^* - p_i) + b_h(p^* - p_i)]
\]
Where \( a \) and \( b \) are known as acceleration coefficients and \( g, h \in (0,1) \) are random numbers.

The \( i^{th} \) particle at \( (j + 1)^{th} \) position is given by:
\[
p_i = p_i + v_i
\]

The constriction factor is:
\[
\delta = \frac{2k}{|\phi - \sqrt{\phi^2 - 4\phi|}}
\]
Where \( \phi = a + b \), is the constriction factor, \( k > 0 \).

The \( i^{th} \) particle at \( (j + 1)^{th} \) position is given by:
\[
p_i = p_i + v_i
\]

Problem (Case I): A vendor selling ùêº‚ÇÄ = 1000 lbs at the rate ùëù = $250 which deteriorating at a rate ùúÉ = 0.001 and the rate at which the product emits carbon gases is ùõæ = 0.5 and the effect of carbon emission on demand is ùêæ = 0.7. The carbon emission and deterioration can be controlled by a proper green investment and preservation technology with sensitivity ùëé = 0.15 and ùëè = 0.13. There is a constant replenishment of ùëÖ = 500 lbs per unit time throughout the planning horizon. The initial demand of the product is ùëë = 150 lbs and the price sensitivity is ùõº = 0.2. The shelf life of the product is ùúè = 150 days. The ordering cost ùëê‚ÇÄ = $[10000,11000], the holding cost of the product is ùêª = $[30, 35], the purchase cost of the product from the source is ùëê = $[250, 255] and the carbon tax is ùëê‚Çë = $[55, 60].

Managerial Implications: In the light of above results, the profit is maximum if the amount of carbon emission follows pattern II, although the vendor has to sell the product within 0.64 days which seems difficult except for the case when the vendor is selling products to the industries in bulk. Similar situation can be observed for pattern III. For pattern I, it can be observed that, the planning horizon is more for selling the product is almost 79 days but it reduces the profit in a significant amount which quite obvious because the seller has bear more holding, deterioration and carbon emission cost is the selling period is more. Further the demand of the product is more if the amount of carbon emission is less. Comparing the results obtained for three different search method it is observed that CPSO produce the better results subject to the statistical analysis.

## Problem (Case II)

A vendor selling ùêº‚ÇÄ = 1000 ùëôùëèùë† at the rate ùëù = $250 which deteriorating at a rate ùúÉ = 0.001 and the rate of carbon emission is probabilistic and the effect of carbon emission on demand is ùêæ = 0.7. The carbon emission and deterioration can be controlled by a proper green investment and preservation technology with sensitivity ùëé = 0.15 and ùëè = 0.13. There is a constant replenishment of ùëÖ = 500 ùëôùëèùë† per unit time throughout the planning horizon. The initial demand of the product is ùëë = 150 ùëôùëèùë† and the price sensitivity is ùõº = 0.2. The shelf life of the product is ùúè = 150 ùëëùëéùë¶ùë†. The ordering cost ùëê‚ÇÄ = $[10000,11000], the holding cost of the product is ùêª = $[30, 35], the purchase cost of the product from the source is ùëê = $[250, 255] and the carbon tax is ùëê‚Çë = $[55, 60]. We consider three probability distributions; Uniform, Triangular and Beta.

For Uniform Distribution: ùõæ‚ÇÅ = 0.5 and ùõæ‚ÇÇ = 0.65. The rate of carbon emission is;

\[
ùõæ = \frac{ùõæ‚ÇÅ + ùõæ‚ÇÇ}{2}
\]

Managerial Implications: In Case II we assumed ùõæ to be probabilistic and observed that, when ùõæ follows uniform and triangular distribution then the supplier must consider the products whose carbon emission follows pattern II and III as for pattern I the average profit is negative. Comparing the profit earned for pattern II and pattern III under uniform and triangular distribution, the manager should select the materials, taking ùõæ under triangular distribution because the preservation cost and green investment is less compared to ùõæ follows uniform distribution. For the products whose rate of carbon emission follows pattern I, it is suggested that the manager should consider the beta distribution for analyzing and decision-making purposes. Further, the manager could select the product whose carbon emission follows pattern II, because the average profit is maximum for pattern II under beta distribution.

Problem (Case III): A vendor selling ùêº‚ÇÄ = 1000 lbs with selling price ùëù probabilistic which is deteriorating at a rate ùúÉ = 0.001 and the rate at which the product emits carbon gases is ùõæ = 0.5 and the effect of carbon emission on demand is ùêæ = 0.7. The carbon emission and deterioration can be controlled by a proper green investment and preservation technology with sensitivity ùëé = 0.15 and ùëè = 0.13. There is a constant replenishment of ùëÖ = 500 lbs per unit time throughout the planning horizon. The initial demand of the product is ùëë = 150 lbs and the price sensitivity is ùõº = 0.2. The shelf life of the product is ùúè = 150 days. The ordering cost ùëê‚ÇÄ = $[10000,11000], the holding cost of the product is ùêª = $[30, 35], the purchase cost of the product from the source is ùëê = $[250, 255] and the carbon tax is ùëê‚Çë = $[55, 60].

For Uniform Distribution: ùëù‚ÇÅ = 250 and ùëù‚ÇÇ = 375. The rate of carbon emission is:
\[
p = \frac{p‚ÇÅ + p‚ÇÇ}{2}
\]

### Interpretation of Sensitivity Analysis
1. Holding cost (ùêª): Profit increases with the decrease in holding cost. Not much effect is observed in the decision variables with the change in holding cost.
2. Carbon emission cost (ùëêùëí): Profit increases with the decrease in carbon emission cost. A mild increase in green investment is observed with the increase in carbon emission cost.

### 11. Conclusion

This is a single product inventory model to provide a decision making process for selecting the right product to sell in an open market. The products considered in this model are perishable in nature and have different rates/amounts of carbon emission. Further, the production industries select those products for manufacturing that have low rates/amounts of carbon emission so that the burden of carbon tax on overall production can be minimized. Thus, the amount of carbon emission has an effect on the demand of the product. Moreover, the selling price reduces with time and eventually diminishes, so the product must be sold within the finite shelf-life. Therefore, both shelf-life and carbon emission affect the demand of a product.

In our present paper, we consider three patterns of carbon emission and analyze the profit earned by the seller. We have also computed optimum preservation cost and green investments to reduce deterioration and carbon emission. We divide the problem into three different cases:

- **In Case I**, we have studied the effective preservation cost and green investment to maximize the profit. It is observed that the product under pattern II emission can generate maximum profit for the supplier.

- **In Case II**, we assume the rate of carbon emission is probabilistic and follows uniform, triangular, and beta distribution. We observed that when the rate of carbon emission follows beta distribution, then the supplier can earn maximum profit.

- **In Case III**, we consider the selling price is probabilistic and follows uniform, triangular, and gamma distribution. We observed that the supplier can generate maximum profit under pattern II when the price follows uniform distribution.

We perform sensitivity analysis and noted that holding cost, carbon emission cost, purchase cost, rate of carbon emission, and shelf-life are sensitive parameters. The supplier should select the product for sale subject to the effect of parameters on the profit function as given in Table 29.

In our present paper, we propose a solution procedure and apply Genetic Algorithm (GA), Weighted PSO (WPSO), and Constriction PSO (CPSO) to solve the profit function for optimization. From the results and statistical analysis given in Tables 1-28, we conclude that constriction PSO provides better results compared to GA and WPSO.

This is an extension in the literature on inventory modeling that studies the effect of emission and shelf-life on the demand of a product and the profit earned by the supplier under both deterministic and stochastic environments, which has not been reported in the literature earlier as per the authors' knowledge. The present model can be further extended to study the effect of trade credit on the demand and profit, and it would be an important study as large vendors and suppliers start their business in a credit system.
