# Abstract
Atmospheric CO₂ source and sink is among the most debated issues that have puzzled climate change geochemists for decades. Here, we tested whether heavy metal pollutants in river sediments favor preservation of organic matter through shielding microbial degradation. We measured CO₂ emission and extracellular enzyme activities at land-water interface (LWI) of 7 sites along a 285 km main stem of the Ganga River and 60 locations up- and downstream of two contrasting point sources discharging urban (Assi drain; Asdr) and industrial (Ramnagar drain; Rmdr) wastewaters to the river. We found the lowest CO₂ flux at Rmdr mouth characterized by the highest concentrations of Cu, Cr, Zn, Pb, Ni, and Cd. The fluxes were relatively higher at locations up- and down-stream Rmdr. Substrate induced respiration (SIR), protease, FDAase, and β-D-glucosidase all showed a similar trend but phenol oxidase and alkaline phosphatase showed opposite trends at the main river stem and Asdr. Sites rich in terrestrially derived organic matter have high phenol oxidase activity with low CO₂ emission. The CO₂ emission in the main river stem showed curvilinear relationships with total heavy metals (∑THM; R² = 0.68; P < 0.001) and TOC (R² = 0.65; p < 0.001). The dynamic model of main stem data showed that the ∑THM above 337.4 μg g⁻¹ were able to significantly decrease the activities of protease, FDAase, and β-D-glucosidase. The study has implications for understanding C-cycling in human-impacted river sediments where metal pollution shields microbial degradation consequently carbon and nutrient release; and merits attention towards river management decisions.

# Introduction
The loading of terrestrially-derived organic carbon (OC) influences ecosystem functioning in rivers and streams along hydrologic continuum, particularly through the processes controlled by microorganisms. Rivers and streams are the primary routes of delivering dissolved- and particulate organic carbon emerging from terrestrial landscapes through inland waters to coastal areas and oceans. Increased interest in understanding the global carbon cycle, as it relates to climate change, has encouraged researchers to work on carbon capture, storage, and release in rivers, oceanic, and terrestrial systems. Land-derived organic-C supply is an important energy source for riverine food webs and ecosystem functions, including carbon and nutrient cycling. A large amount of terrestrially generated organic carbon enters into rivers and streams where it is decomposed, accumulates in bed-sediment, and is transported downstream. A substantial portion of terrestrial plant litter entering forested headwaters is processed immediately by heterotrophic microbes and invertebrate shredders, resulting in significant quantities of fine particulate organic matter which is transported downstream. Furthermore, point sources releasing sewage and industrial effluents and non-point sources such as surface runoff are continuing to add massive amounts of carbon and nutrients to streams and rivers. The presence of both the C-sources (allochthonous and autochthonous) allows uncoupling of primary- and secondary C-production and has implications for food web dynamics, CO₂ emission, and riverine transport.

Being a conducive habitat for microbial metabolism, inland waters act as effective bioreactors, where terrestrial organic matter is rapidly decomposed. The organic matter is relatively short-lived in inland waters (mean residence time 2.5 ± 4.7 years), as compared to centennial to millennial-scale residence times in soils and oceans. Because of the multiplicity of factors that regulate organic matter turnover, such as C-chemistry, sediment characteristics, microbial composition, hydrologic control, and disturbance, forecasting long-term stability of carbon compounds in large rivers is difficult. The microorganisms regulate biogeochemical transformations including the release of carbon dioxide (CO₂). Microbial degradation of organic matter in oxic sediments produces mainly CO₂. Because most of the inland waters are saturated with C gases, they constitute a net source of CO₂ to the atmosphere and are quantitatively important in ecosystem carbon budgets. Despite these facts, the C-metabolism and CO₂ emissions of large rivers remain poorly quantified. Surface waters receive about 1.9 Pg of carbon annually from different natural and anthropogenic sources.

## Material And Methods

### Study area

Anthropogenic sources. About 0.2 Pg of this carbon undergoes burial in sediments and about 0.9 Pg is pushed to the ocean. The balance amount (0.8 Pg) returns to the atmosphere. Global emission of carbon dioxide from lotic waters is about 1.8 ± 0.25 Gt CO₂-C yr⁻¹. This amount is equivalent to about 70% of the oceanic C sink globally. According to Cole and Caraco, the world’s 80 largest rivers add about 0.15–0.3 Pg CO₂-C annually, whereas the inundated floodplains in humid tropics emit 0.9 Pg CO₂-C annually. This amount is about 3 folds of global riverine emission. The US Rivers and streams release about 2370 ± 800 g CO₂-C m⁻² yr⁻¹. Because of strong hydrologic control and heterogeneity of sub-habitats, quantification and prognostics modeling of CO₂ emission in large rivers is very difficult.

Our recent, multi-spatio-temporal scale studies show that, being a stable and biologically active zone, the land-water interface (LWI) of large rivers provides an imprint of hydrodynamic retention characterizing the processes and patterns in close correspondence with those occurring in the main river channel. The LWI can be used as a stable testbed and predictor of river ecosystem responses to human disturbances. The β-D-glucosidase, protease and FDAase are widely used to address soil/sediment microbial processes. The β-D-glucosidase catalyzes the terminal step in cellulose breakdown with subsequent release of glucose monomers to the microorganism. The activity of this enzyme varies with soil/sediment types and positively correlates organic matter supply. Understanding the variations in β-D-glucosidase activity can help understanding sediment/soil C-metabolism and C-cycling. The fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic assay (FDAase) is a widely accepted measure of total microbial activity in soils. The fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis requires three major groups of enzymes, esterases, proteases and lipases involved in the microbial decomposition of organic matter. Also, it is used as a potential indicator of esterase activity of stream biofilms. Phenol oxidase enters the environment through excretion or lysis and mediates lignin degradation and carbon mineralization.

Quantifying CO₂ emission and carbon sequestration in large rivers requires an understanding of factors that regulate microbial processes-linked C-metabolism. The processes which inhibit microbial activities reduce CO₂ emission. Metals, for instance, inhibit microbial activity and consequently, the CO₂ release. Because most of the human impacted rivers simultaneously receive carbon and metal pollutants, it is expected that C enrichment will enhance CO₂ emission whereas metal pollutants will cause a stabilizing effect. Thus, countervailing effect of such disturbances is likely to create a complex pattern of C-dynamics challenging to predict CO₂ release/C-sequestration. A clear understanding of such countervailing effects leading to unanticipated ecosystem consequences is essential for policy decision in river management. The purpose of this work is to fill the gap in our understanding of how point- and non-point sources of carbon and metal input affect C-metabolism and carbon dioxide emission at the LWI of the Ganga River. Here, we have attempted to establish mechanistic links between carbon and metal pollutants to develop a new context to understand collateral implications of human-driven stressors. The study was designed in two parts: First, to evaluate the effects of two contrasting point sources, one releasing metal-rich and the other releasing carbon-rich wastewater, on microbial extracellular enzyme activities and CO₂ emission at LWI; and second, to assess the collateral impacts and linkages with regulatory determinants at selected sites along the main stem of the Ganga River. We attempted to identify patches with variabilities and mechanistic regulatory control which can be used to quantitatively extrapolate system level CO₂ emission scenario for large rivers. The study has relevance in up-scaling system-specific scenario for improving prognostic models of CO₂ emission in addition to evaluating collateral implications of carbon and metal pollution in human-impacted large rivers.

A two-year study (2017 to 2018) was conducted between Allahabad (25°28´N; 81°54´E) and Varanasi (25°19´N; 83°1´E) covering 285 km of the Ganga River. The sampling was done during low flow at six sites - Hatwa (Htwa), Sangam (Sngm), Sitamarhi (Stmh), Adalpura (Adpr), Ramna (Rmna), and Rajghat (Rjht). We consider the least-polluted site, Devprayag (Dvpg), 812 km upstream to Hatwa, as a reference site. Also, we selected two contrasting point sources in the Varanasi region (Assi drain, which discharges 66.4 mld urban sewage and Ramnagar drain, which discharges 24 mld of metal-rich industrial effluents) for trajectory analysis. For trajectories, we collected samples from 30 locations (each 100 m apart), selecting 15 upstream and 15 downstream of each point source (Fig. 1). The Ganga basin, a mixed landscape with predominance of highly fertile agricultural plains (>73% of the total area), supports over 26% of India’s population. The river experiences strong pressure from urban-industrial–agricultural releases and water regulation. The climate is tropical where March to June extends as a hot summer, July to October as a humid rainy season, and November to February as a cold winter. About 90% of the annual precipitation (870-1130 mm) occurs in the rainy season. The relative humidity ranged from 27 to 83% (summer) and 58 to 99% (rainy). Summer temperature maxima may reach 46°C.

## Sampling and analysis

Triplicate samples were collected from the land-water interface (LWI) of three sub-sites considered for each study site using sediment corers. Samples were brought to the laboratory and preserved (4°C) for the analysis of microbial variables. Samples were dried at room temperature, homogenized, and sieved (2-mm mesh) for heavy metals. After digestion in a tri-acid mixture at a ratio of 5:1:1 (HNO₃/HCl/HClO₄) in a microwave digestion system (SINEO model MDS-6G), the samples were analyzed in a Perkin Elmer atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Analyst 800, USA). The detection limits were 0.0008 (Cd), 0.003 (Cr), 0.001 (Cu), 0.006 (Ni), 0.015 (Pb), and 0.001 (Zn) mg/l. The standard stock solutions and drift blanks purchased from Sisco Research Laboratories (India) were used to calibrate the AAS for respective metals. For spiking of samples, we prepared the solutions using nitrate salts of Cd, Cr, Ni, and Pb and granules of Zn and Cu (99% purity). To ensure recovery strength, we repeatedly tested ratios of tri-acids and a 5:1:1 ratio showed 99% recovery.

The sediment samples were analyzed for granulometric fractions (Stemmer et al. 1998). Chlorophyll a, extracted in acetone, was determined spectrophotometrically (Lorenzen and Jeffrey 1980). Conductivity was measured using a multiparameter tester (Oakton 35425-10, USA). The ammonium molybdate stannous chloride method was used to measure soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP; Murphy and Riley 1962). Total organic carbon (TOC) was quantified using a TOC analyzer (LOTIX TOC analyzer). Total nitrogen (TN) was analyzed using Kjeldahl analysis and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) following Ciavatta et al. (1991).

Following a chloroform fumigation extraction, microbial biomass C (Cmic) was measured as per Jenkinson and Powlson (1976), biomass-phosphorus (Pmic) following Brookes et al. (1982), and nitrogen (Nmic) following Shen et al. (1984). The substrate-induced respiration (SIR) was assessed following Wardle et al. (1993). The microbial metabolic quotient was calculated in terms of BR/SIR ratio. Protease activity was measured in terms of aromatic acid released during casein proteolysis and expressed as L-tyrosine equivalents (Ladd and Buttler, 1972). Phenol oxidase was determined as described by Sinsabaugh and Findlay (1995) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) by Tabatabai and Bremner (1969). The β-D-glucosidase was assayed following Eivazi and Tabatabai (1988). For fluorescein diacetate hydrolytic assay (FDAase), the sample filtrates were incubated with fluorescein diacetate, and the fluorescein formed was estimated spectrophotometrically (Schnurer and Rosswall 1982).

The CO₂ at LWI was collected in steel chambers (23 cm height; 22 cm diameter). The chambers contain a small fan for distribution of air, and a thermometer to record temperature. The chambers were fixed 5 cm deep to ensure a seal against ambient air and the gas was withdrawn through a rubber-fitted valve. For quality control, and to avoid changes in temperature and moisture regime, attempts were made to collect samples at an identical time. A polypropylene syringe with a three-way stopper was used for withdrawing the gas from the headspace at 1-h intervals. Samples were brought in an icebox and analyzed in a Trace 1110 Thermo Fisher Analyzer. The accuracy was validated by repeated calibration with standard gas samples.

## Results

### Main stem trends

#### CO₂ emission
The CO₂ flux at land-water interface varied between 83.9 mg m⁻² h⁻¹ (Rjht Site) and 339.2 mg m⁻² h⁻¹ (Sngm Site). The emission flux increased over time except at Rjht where it declined marginally on a temporal scale. At Sngm, the CO₂ emission was 4 folds higher than those at Rjht Site (Fig. 2).

#### Regulatory variables
Substrate-induced respiration (SIR) showed a trend similar to CO₂ emission. The enzyme activity-β-D-glucosidase, protease, and FDAase did show maxima at Sngm Site and minima at Rjht Site whereas the microbial metabolic quotient (qCO₂) showed an opposite trend (Fig. 2). The phenol oxidase and alkaline phosphatase showed highest activity at Stmh Site and lowest at Rjht (Fig. 2).

#### Sediment characteristics
The concentration of metals in the riverbed sediment ranged from 42.2 to 161 μg g⁻¹ (Zn), 35.2 to 188.2 μg g⁻¹ (Cr), 10.2 to 170.2 μg g⁻¹ (Cu), 10.5 to 82.4 μg g⁻¹ (Pb), 0.5 to 7.8 μg g⁻¹ (Cd), and 5.3 to 60.2 μg g⁻¹ (Ni). The values were highest at Rjht followed by Sngm and lowest at Dvpg. The concentrations were highest for Cr and lowest for Cd (Fig 2). In the main river stem, the concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), water soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and total nitrogen (TN) were high at downstream sites. At Rjht Site, the concentrations of TOC, WSOC, and TN were 6 folds, 2.4 folds, and 4.9 folds higher compared to their respective values at reference site Dvpg. The C:N ratio also was highest at Rjht Site. Microbial biomass carbon (Cmic), nitrogen (Nmic), and phosphorus (Pmic) and Chl a biomass showed trends similar to CO₂ emission, with values being highest at Sngm and lowest at Rjht Site. Conductivity and SRP (soluble reactive phosphorus) also followed trends similar to TOC. The proportion of coarse sand was relatively higher at upstream site (Dvpg) and percentage of fine sand was highest at Adpr while clay was highest at Rjht.

The CO₂ emission showed curvilinear relationships with ∑THM (R²= 0.68; P <0.001), TOC (R²= 0.65; P <0.001), and phenol oxidase (R²= 0.72; P <0.001) and significant positive correlations with FDAase, protease, and β-D-glucosidase (R²= 0.89 – 0.92; P <0.001) (Fig. 4).

### Point source up-and down-stream trends

#### CO₂ emission
The CO₂ emission showed longitudinally variable trends at both the point sources. The CO₂ emission was found highest at the mouth of the Assi drain (Asdr; 432 mg m⁻² h⁻¹) and decreased towards downstream and upstream sites. At the mouth of the Ramnagar drain (Rmdr), the CO₂ emission did show the lowest value (10 mg m⁻² h⁻¹). At Rmdr, the CO₂ emission maxima at upstream sites of the drain was found 25 folds higher as compared to the mouth of the drain, whereas downstream maxima was over 38 folds higher. The CO₂ emission showed a gradual increase with distance upstream and downstream from mouth of the drain. The CO₂ flux showed a wide variability and increased over time at Asdr but declined at Rmdr (Fig. 5).

## Sediment characteristics

The concentration of metals at Asdr ranged as:
- Cd, 2.3 to 15.2 μg g-1;
- Cr, 36.2 to 118.3 μg g-1;
- Cu, 22 to 51.2 μg g-1;
- Ni, 21.3 to 78.2 μg g-1;
- Pb, 42 to 77 μg g-1;
- Zn, 51 to 203 μg g-1.

At Rmdr, the values ranged as:
- Cd, 12.2 to 38 μg g-1;
- Cr, 58 to 162 μg g-1;
- Cu, 43 to 122 μg g-1;
- Ni, 64 to 152.3 μg g-1;
- Pb, 62 to 142 μg g-1;
- Zn, 51 to 250 μg g-1.

The concentrations were highest at the drain mouth and values decreased towards upstream and downstream sites. Metal concentrations were 1.5 - 2.34 folds higher at Rmdr compared to Asdr (Fig. 6). The concentrations of WSOC, TOC, and TN, on spatio-temporal scale, showed similar trend at both the study drains. Asdr Site contained 1.5 folds high value of TOC and 1.2 folds high value of WSOC at the mouth as compared to Rmdr mouth. We found an opposite trend for total nitrogen. Microbial biomass-carbon (Cmic), nitrogen (Nmic), phosphorus (Pmic) and Chl a biomass showed trends similar to the CO2 emission at Asdr with maxima at drain mouth (Table 2). We found lowest levels of microbial biomass and Chl a at Rmdr (Table 2, 3). The C:N ratio was found to be the highest at Rmdr mouth and lowest at Asdr mouth. Conductivity and SRP both were highest at Asdr mouth. Both the drains showed high percentage of clay at the mouth (Table 2, 3).

## Principal component analysis

Principal component analysis (PCA) showed three significant PCs for the mainstem and Asdr, and two significant PCs for Rmdr (Table 4). For the mainstem, three PCs collectively explained 92.09 % of the variance. The first PC, which explains 62.12% of the variance, showed strong loading of heavy metals, qCO2, TOC, TN, WSOC and sediment granulometry. Second PC explained 20.02% of the variance with strong loading of microbial activities, Chl a biomass and CO2 emission. Third PC has strong loading of alkaline phosphatase and phenol oxidase with 9.95% variance. The first PC at Asdr (66.12% variance) showed strong loading of microbial activities, TOC, nutrient and granulometry while the second PC with 22.21% of variance showed strong loading of metals and qCO2. The third PC (8.9% variance) separates phenol oxidase and alkaline phosphatase. For Rmdr, two significant PCs were obtained. The first PC explained 67.13% of the variance with strong loading of metals, TOC, TN, C:N ratio, silt, clay and qCO2, whereas PC 2 explained 27.04 % of the variance and separates microbial activities and silt/clay (Table 4).

## Discussion

Aquatic ecosystems serve as reservoirs of terrestrial and anthropogenic-C accumulation. Carbon enrichment interacts with site-specific conditions, including occurrence of other contaminants. Thus, the rate of decomposition vis-à-vis CO2 emission varies subject to the nature of C-source and site-specific conditions, for instance presence of other contaminants. Anthropogenic input of carbon is often accompanied by a large supply of nutrient and non-nutrient contaminants (Smith and Schindler 2009). Thus, the fate of carbon in such water bodies can be strongly influenced by the interaction of multiple pollutants. For instance, nutrient supply, chiefly N and P, can gear-up autochthonous C-build-up and decomposition, whereas metal enrichment can provide countervailing effect. Thus, the complex interactions, especially those pertaining to countervailing effect deserve scaled-up studies from a climate change perspective; and for understanding ecosystem level effects of heavy metal pollution. Land-water interface (LWI) of large rivers provides heterogeneous habitats with imprints of riverine metabolism (Jaiswal and Pandey 2019). Here, we consider LWI to study C-metabolism and CO2 emission as regulated by C-enrichment and metal-driven countervailing effects. This has concern because sewage sources alone add 110 Gg of TOC, 13.28 Gg DIN and 5.29 Gg of DRP annually into the Ganga River. In addition, the basin receives about 1.81 Tg, 2.77 Tg and 0.13 Tg of TOC, TIN, and P, respectively, through atmospheric deposition annually (Singh and Pandey 2018).

The CO₂ emission reported here was significantly lower than those reported for a freshwater marsh (1456.60 ± 593.31 mg m² hr⁻¹) and a brackish water marsh (1435.23 ± 689.71 mg m² hr⁻¹) in the Min River estuary, Southeastern China. Sediment with favorable conditions tends to be substrate limited and shows high in situ activities and low organic matter accumulation. In contrast, sediments with stress conditions are activity limited and show low in situ activities, promoting carbon storage. Also, the enzyme activity limited systems contribute to organic matter accumulation. Earlier research shows that carbon quality and particle size distribution is an important regulator of microbial biomass distribution. Small particle size supports high concentration of TOC and TN, with concentrations generally high in clay, although the C:N ratio declines with diminishing particle size. The downstream sites—Sngm and Asdr—are rich in WSOC, TOC, and TN concentrations and also have a high percentage of clay and silt at the mouth of the drain. High substrate availability coupled with a high percentage of silt and clay may invite the colonization of a large microbial population and create a suitable environment for high microbial/enzyme activities that trigger CO₂ emission.

Here we identified, in addition to other variables, two major determinants—chemical recalcitrance and heavy metal enrichment—to address changes in microbial extracellular enzyme (EE) activities vis-à-vis CO₂ emission along the river gradient. Microbial EEs mediate decomposition and mineralization of organic matter (OM), and terrestrially-derived OM often shows recalcitrance to degradation. Terrestrially derived OM, rich in leaf litter, is generally poor in N content (high C:N ratio) and is poorly decomposable relative to autochthonous C. Lignin and cellulose constitute the most abundant C fractions on land. Lignin accounts for about 30% of organic-C in the terrestrial C reservoir, and 55% of land-sequestered lignin is degraded in the river continuum. Roughly 80 Tg C in the Amazon terrestrial biosphere is fixed as lignin each year. Sites with chemical recalcitrance—measured in terms of phenol/phenol oxidase activity—a signature of terrestrially-derived OC; and those rich in metal pollutants showed a mismatch in CO₂ emission rates and C-inputs. Phenol oxidase is one of the key enzymes able to degrade recalcitrant phenolic materials such as lignin. Phenolic materials are highly inhibitory to enzymes, and their lower abundance at some sites allowed higher hydrolase activities. Sites—Stmh and Adpr—with a high amount of terrestrially derived organic matter showed the highest phenol concentration and high C:N ratio, and CO₂ emission rates were not comparable to C inputs. The downstream sites—Sngm and Rjht—with easily utilizable soft carbon, added from sewage for instance, showed less activity of phenol oxidase but high activity of β-D-glucosidase. Sites with high concentration of Chl a (high autochthonous organic C) did show low phenol oxidase activity and high activity of β-D-glucosidase. The C:N ratio, a proxy of decomposability, was recorded lowest at the highly productive site (Sngm). At the mouth of both the point sources (Asdr; Rmdr), the phenol oxidase activity was found to be the lowest, which increased with upstream and downstream trajectories.

Pandey and Yadav reported very low levels of DO close to the mouth of Assi drain. Thus, low amounts of land-derived OC coupled with oxygen deficiency could decrease phenol oxidase activity, whereas the activity of hydrolases remained relatively higher even in an anaerobic environment. We also tested alkaline phosphatase (AP), an ectoenzyme of microbial origin, used as a measure of P status in soil and sediment. The AP showed a trend similar to phenol oxidase, whereas sediment-SRP showed an opposite trend in the main stem as well as along point sources. Also, the sites with low productivity have high AP and phenol oxidase activities. Overall, these two enzymes can be used as an indicator of less polluted and low CO₂ emission sites; whereas, high activities of other enzymes indicate sites acting as a hotspot of CO₂ emission.

We further tested whether heavy metal enrichment was able to reduce EE activities and CO₂ emission in the main stem and source-oriented sites. The countervailing effect of heavy metals at Rjht and Rmdr reduced CO₂ emission. The NMDS separated microbial biomass, EE activity, Chl a biomass, and CO₂ emission in one group between the Sngm and Rmna. Asdr also showed a similar pattern, whereas Rmdr the NMDS showed that the microbial activity maximum at the downstream sites. The granulometry and organic matter content affect the distribution of heavy metal. Fine-grained sediments tend to have relatively higher metal contents due in part to the high specific surface of particles. Positive correlations among metals, organic substrate, and sediment particle size validate this concept.

## Conclusions

The auto- and allochthonous–C input in human-impacted large rivers is continuously increasing, and these increases are often paralleled by almost similar increases in metal pollutants. Many lines of evidence presented here indicate that, although CO₂ emission in human-impacted large rivers is controlled by a multiplicity of factors, including chemical recalcitrance, high concentrations of heavy metals suppress the microbial-extracellular enzyme activities responsible for organic matter decomposition and consequently, the magnitude of CO₂ emission. Although we still have very little knowledge of how and to what extent these factors interact, it is clear that the presence of heavy metals can significantly alter the dynamics of carbon cycling in these ecosystems.

## Section 7.8: Microbial Activity and Carbon Emission

### 7.8.1 Microbial Response to Heavy Metals

The Rjht and Rmdr Sites showed carbon storage in bed sediment. Despite high substrate availability, there were relatively lower in situ microbial/enzymatic activities. Many investigators have reported that heavy metal stressors can induce changes in microbial biomass and activity. The microorganisms release extracellular enzymes (EEs) to activate the lysis of organic matter. The EEs are produced as a result of cellular metabolism influenced by carbon and nutrient availability. The EEs are highly sensitive towards toxicants, including heavy metals, and respond sharply to even small changes in sediment quality.

### 7.8.2 Nutrient Supply and Microbial Activity

Nutrient supply stimulates microbial activity and decomposition of organic matter, and under appropriate temperature and water conditions, leads to high respiration and CO₂ emission. We found significant positive correlations between C availability and CO₂ emission at Asdr. However, at metal-rich locations, this relationship implied up to certain levels only. As the concentration of metal increased, this relationship weakened. It seems that the microbial activities, and consequently the CO₂ release at LWI, are constrained by high concentrations of toxic metals.

### 7.8.3 Implications for Carbon Sequestration

The dynamic model showed that total metal concentration above 337.4 μg g⁻¹ induces adverse effects on CO₂ emission. In all three subsets of studies, PCA separated metals opposite to CO₂ emission and microbial/enzyme activities. The NMDS yielded almost similar results. The Asdr Site showed low levels of total heavy metal (ΣTHM < 337.4 μg g⁻¹), with microbial activities relatively higher, and consequently, the excess supply of C could assume importance triggering CO₂ emission. Previous studies have shown a marked decrease in Cmic and enzyme activities in metal-polluted soils and sediments. We found significant positive relationships between qCO₂ and metal concentrations. Earlier studies show that Cmic declines and qCO₂ increases as metal concentration increases. Metal-associated changes in C-utilization have been considered a microbial response to stressors and are used as an indicator of metal pollution. Overall, the patterns of CO₂ emission shown here demonstrate that the distribution of co-occurrence of metal and C-sources ultimately regulate the pattern of carbon sequestration in the Ganga River. Similar spatial trajectories can be expected for other human-impacted rivers, suggesting the need for caution in regional C-budgeting and modeling.

what magnitude metal enrichment will effect organic matter decomposition and CO₂ release, our study clearly indicates that at source oriented locations, total metal concentration was sufficient to suppress microbial/enzyme activities vis-à-vis CO₂ release. We conclude that the overall impacts of heavy metal pollution on large rivers are probably much larger than what is generally predicted. When riverine-C sequestration is considered, a completely different scenario emerges: a transition towards metal pollution leads to increased C storage relative to loss as CO₂. This has implications for understanding C-cycling in human-impacted river sediments where metal pollution shields microbial degradation, and consequently, carbon and nutrient release. While this type of analysis is urgently needed from a climate change perspective, further studies need to include carbon-stabilizing effects for assessing ecosystem level impacts of heavy metal pollution for management and rejuvenation of large rivers.
