## Experimental Procedures

The CDs used in this study were synthesized by a one-step synthesis, already reported in a previous paper, and similar to previous studies in the literature. In short, a solution of urea (3 g), citric acid monohydrate (3 g), both obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, dispersed in Milli-Q water (10 mL) was heated up to the boiling point. Once water completely evaporated, an aggregate of CDs appearing as a dark powder was collected. The CD nanopowder was further dried in a vacuum for 30-60 min, in order to remove small organic molecules which may be occasionally formed as contaminants of the nanomaterial during bottom-up CD synthesis. These CDs are highly N-doped and show the typically bright and tunable photoluminescence reported for many other N-doped CDs in the literature.

We recently studied in depth the structure of these CDs by a combination of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction, atomic force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared absorption. All the results point to describe the end product of the synthesis as consisting in a collection of quasispherical nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 1 to 5 nm, with an average of 3 nm. These carbon dots are found to have a well-defined, β − C₃N₄ crystalline core structure surrounded by a subnanometric shell hosting amide, carboxylic and hydroxyl groups. In particular, we demonstrated that the N/C ratio estimated by XPS closely matches the stoichiometric ratio expected for a carbon nitride structure, and all electron diffraction Debye-Sherrer rings can be assigned to the β − C₃N₄ structure. These results have been published in detail elsewhere.

Here, we dispersed these CDs in 14 different solvents obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, Merck and Fluka. Specifically, we used eight protic solvents: water, methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), 2-propanol (IsOH), glycerol, ethylene glycol (EG), polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG400) and deuterated water (D₂O), and six aprotic solvents: acetone, acetonitrile (ACN), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dichloromethane (DCM), 1,4-dioxane.

The absorption spectra were recorded with a double beam spectrophotometer (JASCO V-560) operating in the 200-900 nm range (4.30-1.50 eV). For a concentration of 0.02 mg/mL we measure an absolute absorption of ∼0.25 OD at 3.05 eV in a 1 cm cuvette. During this work we used two different instruments to record photoluminescence measurements: a commercial spectrofluorometer, and a laser-excited photoluminescence setup. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements and most of the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on an intensified charge coupled device (CCD) camera while exciting the sample by a tunable laser system consisting in an optical parametric oscillator pumped by a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (5 ns pulses at 10 Hz repetition rate). The energy of laser pulses was about 0.1 mJ and the spectral resolution is 4 nm (guaranteed by using an appropriate monochromator and a slit). The CCD camera records the emission spectra after variable delays respect to laser pulses in a fixed time window of 0.5 ns. When using this setup, steady-state PL spectra were obtained by time-integrating the spectra captured within a temporal window extending from before photoexcitation to a few hundreds of nanoseconds after excitation. The decay kinetics of the fluorescence was measured by extracting the time dependence of the spectrally-integrated emission intensity and the decay curves were least-squares fitted to a single exponential fitting function (I(t) ∝ exp (−t/τ)) or to a stretched exponential fitting function (I(t) ∝ exp (−(t/τ)β)). The accuracy on the lifetime value is about 0.5 ns. We also used a JASCO FP6500 spectrofluorometer to record some of the steady-state PL spectra, all the photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectra, and to measure the

## Emission Quantum Yield (QY)

This instrument is equipped with a xenon lamp as a source and a photomultiplier as a detector. The accuracy on the peak’s position is about 0.01 eV. We measured the QY by comparing the steady-state emission intensity with that obtained from an aqueous solution (pH=13) of fluorescein excited at 470 nm, used as a reference of known QY=0.95. To this aim, the fluorescence from the sample and the reference were measured in exactly the same conditions and geometry. Then, the quantum yield values were calculated according to the following equation (the subscripts R indicate the reference quantities):

\[
QY = \frac{QY_R A (1 - 10^{-OD_R n^2})}{A_R (1 - 10^{-OD n^2})}
\]

where A is the area of the photoluminescence band, OD is the value of absorbance, and n is the refractive index. The accuracy on the QY value is about 0.01. All the optical measurements were carried out at room temperature in 1 cm quartz cuvettes.

To perform single molecule spectroscopy measurements, quartz coverslips (Structure Probe Inc.) were cleaned by sonication in an alkaline cleaning solution (Hellma Analytics, Hellmanex III), followed by sonication in and rinsing with demineralized water, drying by nitrogen flow, and an ozone dry-cleaning procedure (UVP, PR-100) for 30 min. Samples with a low average particle density (< 1/μm²) were prepared by drop-casting a dilute solution (∼ 0.5 μg/mL) of CDs in water on a coverslip. Single molecule spectroscopy measurements were carried out using an inverted microscope (Zeiss, AxioObserver Z1) coupled to a spectrometer (Princeton Instruments, Acton SP2300) and a CCD (Princeton Instruments, Pylon 400B) in a wide-field scheme. Continuous wave excitation was provided by the 488 nm (∼ 90 W/cm²) line of an Ar⁺ laser (Spectra-Physics, Stabillite 2017) and the emitted light was collected using a 100x air objective (Zeiss, Epiplan-Neofluar NA 0.75). The emission from CDs, as observed under the microscope, remained stable under laser exposure over a typical...

Fluorescence quantum yield, decay lifetime (b is the stretching parameter, if smaller than one), radiative and non-radiative decay rate measured for CDs dispersed in each solvent and excited at 2.82 eV. QY measurements were not possible in some of the most apolar solvents where a low solubility hindered a reliable estimate of the absorption coefficient, needed to calculate the QY. In the table, these cases are indicated as ND - not determined.**

**Figure S3:** Emission spectra of CDs (panel a) and their decay kinetics (panel b) in water (τ = 4.8 ns) (red line) and in deuterated water (τ = 10.7 ns) (blue line). Measurements were obtained upon excitation at 2.82 eV photon energy (440 nm wavelength). Having the two samples been prepared in the same concentration, the intensities of the two spectra in panel a reflect the different emission QYs. From the measured values of lifetime and QY, we obtain radiative and non-radiative rates reported in Table S1.
