Absorption heat pump Membrane distillation Brine concentration Feed recirculation Space cooling Solar thermal

Desalination is the primary choice for securing freshwater provision in water- stressed regions and reduces the gap between rising demand and dwindling natural freshwater resources. However, global desalination plants are dominated by fossil fuel- driven desalination technologies with a  $40 - 50\%$  recovery ratio. Hence, it is critical to decarbonize desalination and address brine effluent ecological concerns. In this paper, a solar- powered absorption heat pump (AHP)- membrane distillation (MD) system concept was proposed and analysed for small- scale RO plant brine reject management and space cooling applications. The MD subsystem is based on commercial MD modules with batch feed recirculation to reach saturation (from 70 to  $260~\mathrm{g / kg}$  salinity). The MD system's heating and cooling consumptions are supplied by the AHP (6.54 MWh and 13.47 MWh, respectively, for a complete batch cycle). The AHP is designed to supply hot water at  $85^{\circ}C$  with  $701.63\mathrm{kW}$  heating capacity and co- produced chilled water at  $16^{\circ}C$  with a cooling capacity of  $857.86\mathrm{kW}$ , about  $67\%$  is utilized to cool down the brine reject to feed temperature. The thermal and exergy COPs were 1.27/3 and 0.40 at a driving heat of  $135^{\circ}C$ . The solar- powered AHP- MD system is useful for sustainable desalination deployment besides space cooling applications.

# 1. Introduction

The global freshwater demand is expected to rise significantly over the coming decades due to rapid population growth, economic development, and lifestyle- driven changes in consumption patterns. The United Nations estimates about 4.8- 5.7 billion people live in areas that are potentially water- scarce at least one month per year by 2050 [1]. Besides, if current trends of global water consumption, which are driven mainly by the aforementioned causes, will lead to a  $40\%$  deficit in freshwater supplies by 2030 [2]. Also, when combined with dwindling natural freshwater reserves caused by climate change, it is exacerbating global water shortage. Consequently, desalination technologies are required to close the gap between freshwater demand and supply. Even though desalination can deliver more reliable and climate- independent freshwater from saline water resources (e.g., seawater) available in abundance, its wider adoption is limited by the large energy footprint and associated water treatment cost. Particularly,  $30 - 50\%$  of total water cost comes from energy consumption alone [3- 5], which is currently dominated by fossil fuel- driven seawater desalination systems [5]. As the global deployment of desalination plants rises, which is projected to be 200 million  $\mathrm{m^3 / day}$  by the end of 2030, its carbon footprint is expected to reach a considerable level  $(1 - 10\mathrm{kg}\mathrm{CO_2} / \mathrm{m^3}$  of desalinated water), which implies a critical need to decarbonize desalination and produce freshwater sustainably [5].

Conventional seawater desalination is advantageous from the economics of scale, which has led to the implementation of large treatment facilities  $(>50,000\mathrm{m}^3 /\mathrm{day}$  [5]) along the coastline accompanied by vast distribution systems that transport seawater to the centralized desalination plant and deliver desalted water to end user. Recent studies have shown that water delivery costs can even exceed treatment costs, e.g., the pumping electricity cost alone can reach up to  $40\%$  of the desalinated water cost in water- stressed regions [6]. Hence, decentralized desalination concepts have received considerable interest in recent years [5,7]. Moreover, solar desalination is an attractive technological option since water- scarce regions mostly overlap with good solar resources, which is also favoured by the move toward the deployment of decentralized desalination systems, especially for remote communities as stand- alone systems.

At present, reverse osmosis (RO) has become the most energyefficient and widely adopted seawater (and brackish water) desalination technology [2,8,9].Conventional seawater RO (SwRO) plant operates at a pressure of 50- 70 bar recovering  $40 - 50\%$  of feed seawater as desalted water with the RO brine rejected back into the sea at approximately  $60 - 70\mathrm{g / kg}$  of salinity [10]. According to operational data of the SwRO plants from the literature, an average worldwide SWRO plant operated at a recovery ratio of  $42\%$  with about 60 bar operating pressure [10]. Furthermore, in the last decade, advances in RO membrane technology have allowed the development of high- pressure RO (HPRO) systems that can operate up to pressures of 120 bar corresponding to RO brine reject salinity of  $120~\mathrm{g / kg}$  [10]. However, these HPRO systems are new and have not yet been adopted widely by the desalination industry [10]. Desalination brine reject is commonly discharged into the environment, and it has adverse impacts, especially in the case of inland desalination plants. Further, desalination brine discharge to sea (and ocean) causes disturbance to marine ecosystems. Several brine disposal methods are employed for instance sewer disposal, deep- well injection, evaporation ponds, etc [11,12]. Inland locations face restrictions with surface discharge due to the environmental impact of hypersaline brine whereas deep- well injection has geographic limitations aside from economic and environmental costs. Accordingly, there is a strong driver to pursue zero liquid discharge (ZLD) or minimal liquid discharge (MLD) processes as a brine management strategy for both coastal and inland desalination facilities [13,14]. Also, ZLD and MLD processes can have other useful outcomes, such as increasing water productivity, resource recovery, and/or valorising the produced solids.

Heat pumps have vast potential as sustainable solutions to address the freshwater shortage by integrating with desalination systems thereby increasing energy efficiency. The integration of heat pumps with main desalination processes (i.e., evaporation- , membrane- , and humidification- dehumidification- based desalination) for performance augmentation was reviewed and investigated in the literature [15]. The overview of research studies on the use of heat pumping technologies (both electrical- and thermal- driven heat pumps) with the different types of desalination systems is discussed as follows.

The potential of a transcritical CO2- based heat pump integrated with a hybrid membrane distillation (MD)- multi- stage flash (MSF) desalination system was investigated for large- scale applications using thermodynamic and environmental analysis [16]. The CO2 heat pump provides both heating- for- potable water production and possible cooling output which can be utilized for the cooling of the produced potable water or district cooling applications. The study examined six configurations of the integrated CO2 heat pump- MD- MSF desalination system with various degrees of complexity from simple to complex layouts. When the potential cooling output was utilized, the integrated system outperformed the RO desalination system (i.e., electricity demand was reduced from  $9.6\mathrm{kWh} / \mathrm{m}^3$  to  $3.2\mathrm{kWh} / \mathrm{m}^3$  ) otherwise it is comparable with the modern RO desalination system.

A system integrating a heat pump, multi- effect desalination (MED), and ice storage subsystems was proposed for seawater desalination and ice production [17]. The heat pump provides both required heating and cooling energies for the desalination and ice (and/or chilled water) production. The system's simulated performance was compared with the conventional mechanical vapour compression (MvC) desalination system and air- conditioning system under various scenarios (i.e., based on chosen countries with different freshwater and electricity prices). The obtained simulation results demonstrated that the proposed integrated system is more energy efficient than the conventional systems by about  $47.3\%$  (4.71 kWh/t and 8.94 kWh/t, respectively). Moreover, the integrated system produced more freshwater  $(\sim 1734.6\mathrm{t / d})$  than the conventional system  $(\sim 1680\mathrm{t / d})$  and the payback period of the integrated system is shorter by around  $34.8\%$  (3.85 years for the integrated system and 5.9 years for the conventional system).

A multi- function integrated system operating, at least, three modes of operation was proposed and investigated using energy and exergy analysis for freshwater production, cooling, and heating during different seasons [18]. The multi- function system consists of a single- effect  $\mathrm{H_2O / LiBr}$  absorption heat pump (AHP), a single- effect  $\mathrm{H_2O / LiBr}$

absorption refrigeration heat pump (ARHP, which functions as both a refrigeration unit and a heat pump for heating), and a low- temperature multi- effect evaporation (LT- MEE) desalination unit. The system's three modes of operation were a water- refrigeration mode for summer, a water- only mode for spring and autumn, and a water- heating mode for winter; thus, the system was able to meet the demands of different seasons throughout the whole year. It is driven by motive steam with pressure from 1.5 bar to 3.5 bar with the LT- MEE driven by steam (condensation temperature from  $58^{\circ}C$  to  $72^{\circ}C$  -

A multi- effect evaporation (MEE) desalination system was integrated into a single- stage  $\mathrm{H_2O / LiBr}$  AHP to obtain the best optimal operation conditions [19]. The system was evaluated using conventional and advanced exergy and exergoeconomic analyses. The optimized MEF- AHP system produces  $15,000\mathrm{m}^3 /\mathrm{d}$  of freshwater with an exergy efficiency of  $10.3\%$  and a total product cost rate of  $0.11\mathrm{S / s}$  .The optimized system, which is obtained by minimizing overall avoidable cost rates, was able to reduce the total product cost rates by around 33.3  $\%$  and increase the exergy efficiency by  $4.8\%$  compared to the base operating conditions of the system.

The MED desalination system energy consumption is reduced using an  $\mathrm{NH_3 / H_2O}$  absorption- compression heat pump with wastewater as a low- temperature heat source [20]. The integrated MED-  $\mathrm{NH_3 / H_2O}$  heat pump produced  $5000\mathrm{t / d}$  of freshwater, and its performance depends on the heat pump operating conditions (absorber and desorber pressures, which are related to temperatures of the supplied heat to the MED process and waste heat source, respectively). The operating conditions at which the system becomes economically profitable were identified based on Net Present Value evaluation, and the absorber pressure  $< 25$  bar and desorber temperature  $>30^{\circ}C$  (at the desorber pressure of 5 bar). The MED-  $\mathrm{NH_3 / H_2O}$  heat pump was competitive compared to RO technology, and the payback period was within 3 years.

The polygeneration schemes involving desalination systems and solar thermal- collector technologies have been proposed as effective and promising ways of addressing water scarcity [21- 23]. A solar thermal- powered membrane- based polygeneration system for electrical power, cooling, heating, and freshwater production was proposed and evaluated based on a comprehensive multicriteria assessment approach [21]. The polygeneration system comprises an organic Rankine cycle, a Kalina power cycle, an  $\mathrm{NH_3 / H_2O}$  refrigeration system, and a hybrid pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) and forward osmosis (FO) desalination system. The system can produce  $3153.6\mathrm{t / year}$  of freshwater with net electrical power, heating, and cooling outputs of around  $3.032\mathrm{MW}$  8 MW, and  $0.401\mathrm{MW}$  respectively. An  $\mathrm{NH_3 / H_2O}$  - based integrated system was proposed and analysed for the provision of cooling, electrical power, and seawater desalination [22]. The system consists of a Kalina power cycle, an ejector refrigeration cycle, and a multi- stage spray flash evaporation (SFE) desalination system. An energy and economic comparative study was conducted for two polygeneration system configurations driven by solar collector technologies (i.e., evacuated tube collector (ETC) and Linear Fresnel Reflector (LFR)) [23]. The polygeneration system provides domestic hot water, space heating, space cooling (using the absorption chiller), and desalinated water. The first system option is based on ETC and a single- effect  $\mathrm{H_2O / LiBr}$  absorption chiller; and the second option is based on LFR with a double- effect  $\mathrm{H_2O / LiBr}$  absorption chiller. The seawater desalination is carried out by the MED process in both options and a biomass- fired auxiliary heater was used. Thus, for the analysed case study, the ETCs were more profitable than LFRs, achieving simple pay- back periods of about 4- 5 years.

Based on the above literature overview of prior studies, the following research gaps were identified.

Previously proposed heat pump integrated desalination systems were mainly focused on energy efficiency improvement and economic profitability of seawater desalination but not on the brine concentration of seawater desalination plants.

No solar thermal- driven heat pump coupled desalination system for reject brine management has been investigated. Although heat pumps are capable of providing heating and cooling simultaneously most heat pumps are integrated with thermal desalination systems for supplying the required driving heat; however, brine concentrate cooling is also needed especially in brine management with feed recirculation. Solar- driven  $\mathrm{NH_3 / H_2O}$  absorption heat pumps integrated with thermal desalination systems for decentralized sustainable desalination applications are scarce in the reported literature.

There is thus the need to develop a solar- powered distributed desalination system with brine management to sustainably address the pressing global water scarcity challenges. In this study, a new solar- driven absorption heat pump- membrane distillation (AHP- MD) system concept is proposed for combined seawater RO plant reject brine desalination and space cooling applications. The MD subsystem is driven by low- grade heat released (at  $85^{\circ}C$  from the condenser of the integrated AHP, and it is used for high recovery brine concentration to reach saturation via batch feed recirculation. The MD system is chosen to desalinate hyper- saline brine since the RO systems concentrating brine to a higher salinity  $(>120~\mathrm{g / kg}$  e.g.,  $260~\mathrm{g / kg})$  do not currently exist in operation due to the high operating pressures required for brine concentration. In addition, MD systems are driven by low- grade heat  $(< 100^{\circ}C)$  while RO units require high- quality energy input in the form of electricity/mechanical work. The AHP used in the proposed system is designed for the co- production of cooling, e.g., for space conditioning applications besides the heating provided to the MD system. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the layout of the proposed solar- powered AHP- MD system and its components as well as the coupled conventional SWRO plant. Section 3 presents details of the modelling of system components. Then, Section 4 presents and discusses the obtained results of the proposed solar- powered AHP- MD system, and, finally, the paper concludes with a summary of the key findings in Section 5.

# 2. Solar-powered AHP-MD system: RO brine concentration and cooling applications

Fig. 1 depicts the proposed solar- powered AHP- MD- RO hybrid desalination system concept for sustainable seawater desalination and space cooling applications. The hybrid RO- MD desalination system is designed for decentralized small- scale applications  $(< 1000\mathrm{m}^3 /\mathrm{day})$  with MLD or ZLD process for sustainable desalination. The system's main components and subsystems are a single- stage seawater RO plant, a vacuum- assisted air gap membrane distillation (V- AGMD) system (used as the MD brine concentrator in Fig. 1), a single- stage  $\mathrm{NH_3 / H_2O}$  AHP for simultaneous heating and cooling supplies (AHP4SHC), solar thermal (ST) subsystem, and brine and permeate tanks for the batch operation of the V- AGMD system. The saturated brine  $(260~\mathrm{g / kg}$  of salinity) discharge of the MD system is fed to a salt crystallizer to produce salt using state- of- the- art crystallization technology based on multi- effect evaporators [24] or evaporation pond [25].

# 2.1. Conventional RO desalination plant

The RO desalination plant configuration chosen in this study, shown in Fig. 1, was a typical single- stage RO unit arrangement with a circulation pump (CP), a high- pressure pump (HHP), a booster pump (BP), and a pressure exchanger (PX) for energy recovery. After pretreatment, seawater feed (stream 1) enters the RO desalination plant at ambient temperature and pressure. The feed stream from the CP (2), is then split into two streams (3 and 4), a feed stream goes to an HPP (stream 4) and a feed stream to the PX (stream 3). The HPP then pressurizes part of the feed (stream  $4\rightarrow 6$  ) to a high pressure  $(P_{RPP}^{HPP})$  , needed to overcome the

osmotic pressure difference,  $\Delta \tau$ , and pressure losses in the RO module  $(\Delta P_{RO}^{loss})$ . The other feed stream is pressurized  $(3 \rightarrow 5)$  by the PX using work produced via the depressurization of brine in the rotor (stream  $10 \rightarrow 11$ ), which is then passed to the BP (stream  $5 \rightarrow 7$ ) to reach the pressure  $P_{RO}^{HPP}$ . The two feed streams then combined (i.e., 6 and  $7 \rightarrow 8$ ) before entering the RO module and afterward separated into permeate (stream 9) and a concentrated brine stream (10) at a marginally lower pressure due to hydraulic losses. The permeate and concentrate brine reject (leaving the PX, stream 11) from the RO plant feed to permeate and brine tanks at atmospheric pressure, respectively.

# 2.2. MD brine concentrator with batch feed recirculation

The applied MD subsystem to concentrate the RO plant's reject, stored in the brine tank, is based on a vacuum- assisted air gap membrane distillation module (V- AGMD, type AS26C2.7L) from the Aquastill BV (Netherlands) shown in Fig. 2a and b). The V- AGMD module uses a spiral- would multi- envelope (24 evaporation and cooling channels, 12 for each channel) with a membrane area of  $25.92 \mathrm{~m}^2$  and its internal flow arrangement is illustrated in Fig. 2(c). The AS26 module is used in this simulation study and its technical details are available in Ref. [26]. For the ZLD applications using the MD system, the RO brine reject needs to be concentrated in the range of  $232 - 279 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$  which is an input brine to salt crystallizers while for the MLD the range is between 139 and 167  $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{L}$  [27]. To reach saturation from the RO brine reject (e.g., from salinity of  $70 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$  to  $260 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) needs a very high recovery ratio of  $\sim 73.1 \%$  [28].

This is not possible per single pass of the MD module, which can reach up to a  $7 \%$  recovery ratio at high feed salinity in the case of the AS26 module [32]. Hence, the batch feed recirculation operational strategy is implemented in the present study, this recirculation mode is chosen since it is more energy efficient than other operational strategies (e.g., continuous recirculation, Refs. [28,33]).

The feed from the brine tank (stream 12) is pumped by the CP and

preheated in the condenser channels of the MD module (stream  $13 \rightarrow 14$ ). The preheated feed is then heated (stream  $14 \rightarrow 15$ ) in heat exchanger 1 (HX1) to the required evaporator channels inlet temperature using external heat input obtained from the coupled  $\mathrm{NH_3 / H_2O}$  single- stage AHP. The feed solution evaporation (stream  $15 \rightarrow 16$ ) then takes place in the evaporator channels in a counter- current arrangement with flows in the condenser channels. The evaporator outlet stream (16) is returned to the brine storage tank after being cooled down (stream  $16 \rightarrow 17$ ) in the heat exchanger 2 (HX2) using cooling energy produced by the AHP. Finally, the produced distilled water (stream 18) is collected in the permeate storage tank. The brine desalination process (stream  $12 \rightarrow 13 \rightarrow 14 \rightarrow 15 \rightarrow 16 \rightarrow 17$  and 18) is repeated in a batch mode of operation up to the required recovery ratio (i.e., desired final concentrate brine salinity) set for the ZLD (or MLD) applications. Then, the cycle is completed, and the final brine (stream 19) is discharged to a conventional salt crystallizer system (or evaporative pond) in the case of the ZLD; after that, a new batch operation starts and the brine concentration cycle is repeated.

# 2.3. Absorption heat pump (AHP)

A single- stage AHP cycle using  $\mathrm{NH_3 / H_2O}$  mixture as a working fluid is designed for the delivery of the heating and cooling needs of the MD brine concentrator (i.e., MD subsystem using AS26 module). The single- stage  $\mathrm{NH_3 / H_2O}$  AHP cycle schematic is depicted in Fig. 3 (a) and its representation on the pressure- temperature diagram is shown in Fig. 3 (b).

The AHP comprises four major components that exchange heat with external heat carrier loops: absorber (ABS); condenser (CON); desorber (DES); and evaporator (EVA). The other AHP cycle's components are a rectifier (REC), solution and refrigerant heat exchangers (SHX and RHX), solution and refrigerant expansion valves (SEV and REV), and solution circulation pump (SP). The rectifier is internally cooled by the  $\mathrm{NH_3}$ - rich solution leaving the absorber prior to entering the solution heat exchanger. The heating output of the AHP (stream  $20 \rightarrow 21$ ) is obtained using the heat released by the condenser while the cooling is provided by the evaporator as shown in Fig. 3. The AHP supplies chilled water (stream  $26 \rightarrow 27$ , using a circulation pump, CP3, Fig. 1) to the MD subsystem. Depending on the MD brine reject's cooling demand (which is supplied by chilled water stream  $22 \rightarrow 23$  in Fig. 1), the remaining chilled water (stream  $24 \rightarrow 25$ , in Fig. 1) is used for space cooling applications. The driving hot water (stream  $30 \rightarrow 31$ ) produced by the integrated ST plant is provided to the desorber of the absorption heat pump. The absorber rejects heat to the external cooling water loop (stream  $28 \rightarrow 29$ ), which can be the available saline feed resource (seawater), or ambient air using an indirectly (or directly) air- cooled absorber design.

# 2.4. Solar thermal (ST) subsystem

The solar thermal collector technology used in this study is a parabolic trough collector (PTC) manufactured by Absolicon Solar Collector AB (Sweden) [34]. The Absolicon T160 PTC with glass covering is shown in Fig. 4. The T160 collector produces hot water in the temperature range of  $60^{\circ}\mathrm{C} - 160^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  [35]. The solar thermal subsystem, depicted in Fig. 1, comprises a PTC solar field, a thermal storage tank (TST), an auxiliary heater (AH), and circulation pumps (CP1 and CP2). The CP1 is used to circulate the heat transfer fluid (HTF), water, between the solar collector field and thermal storage tank while the CP2 is utilized for the circulation of the heat transfer fluid between the thermal storage tank and desorber of the absorption heat pump.

# 3. Modelling methodology

# 3.1. RO desalination process model

The modelling of the conventional RO desalination process is based on Refs. [10,36,37]. The electrical power consumed by each pump  $\dot{W}_{p,el}^{RO}$  in kW, for the feed CP, HPP, and BP) is given by:

$$
\dot{W}_{p,el}^{RO} = \left(\frac{1}{\eta_p}\right)\frac{\dot{m}_p^{RO}(P_{out} - P_{in})}{\rho_f} \tag{1}
$$

where  $\dot{m}_p^{RO}$  is the mass flow rate  $(\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{s})$ ,  $P_{in}$  and  $P_{out}$  are the pump inlet and outlet pressures  $(\mathrm{kPa})$ ,  $\eta_p$  pump efficiency (taken as  $85\%$ ), and  $\rho_f$  is the density  $(\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^3)$  of feed seawater. The pressure increase by the feed CP is set to 1.0 bar. The high pressure needed for the RO plant  $(P_6 = P_7 = P_8$ , in Fig. 1) is given by Ref. [38]:

$$
P_{6} = \pi_{b} + \Delta P_{pinch} + \Delta P_{loss} \tag{2}
$$

where  $\Delta P_{pinch}$  is the terminal hydraulic- osmotic pressure pinch value and set to 10 bar (Ref. [38]),  $\Delta P_{loss}$  denotes the extra consumed work needed to overcome viscous losses in each RO stage (and its value assumed as 2.0 bar, Ref. [38]),  $\pi_b$  is the osmotic pressure  $(\mathrm{kPa})$  at the end of the RO unit, which was obtained using the seawater osmotic pressure correlation available in the literature [39]. Thus, the sum of  $\Delta P_{pinch}$  and  $\Delta P_{loss}$  is the required overpressure (i.e. above the osmotic pressure,  $\pi_b$ ) of the RO

stage [40]. The pressure recovered by the PX ( $P_{5}$  in kPa) of the RO desalination plant is calculated by using Eq. (3).

$$
P_{5} = P_{3} + \eta_{px}\left(\frac{\rho_{3}}{\rho_{10}}\right)(P_{10} - P_{11}) \tag{3}
$$

where  $\eta_{px}$  is the PX efficiency and is taken as  $96\%$  [10].  $\rho_{3}$  and  $\rho_{10}$  are feed and RO brine concentrate densities in  $\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$  respectively. The feed mass flow rate through the PX (stream  $3\rightarrow 5$  Fig.1) is assumed equal to the brine mass flow rate through the PX (stream  $10\rightarrow 11$

The total electrical power consumed,  $\dot{W}_{tot,el}^{RO}$  in kW, by the RO desalination plant is:

$$
\dot{W}_{tot,el}^{RO} = \dot{W}_{CP,el}^{RO} + \dot{W}_{HPP,el}^{RO} + \dot{W}_{BP,el}^{RO} \tag{4}
$$

where  $\dot{W}_{CP,el}^{RO}$ ,  $\dot{W}_{HPP,el}^{RO}$ , and  $\dot{W}_{BP,el}^{RO}$  are electrical power consumed by the CP, HPP, BP, respectively, computed using Eq. (1). The RO desalination plant performance is estimated by recovery ratio  $(RR_{RO})$  and specific energy consumption  $(SEC_{RO}$  in  $\mathrm{kWh} / \mathrm{m}^3$  of produced permeate water) given by Eq. (5) and Eq. (6).

$$
RR_{RO} = \frac{\dot{m}_p^{RO}}{\dot{m}_f^{RO}} \tag{5}
$$

where  $\dot{m}_p^{RO}$  is the mass flow rate  $(\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{s})$  of permeate water and  $\dot{m}_f^{RO}$  is the mass flow rate of feed seawater.

$$
SEC_{RO} = \frac{\dot{W}_{tot,el}^{RO}}{\dot{V}_p^{RO}} \tag{6}
$$

where  $\dot{V}_p^{RO}$  is the permeate water produced in  $\mathrm{m}^3 /\mathrm{hr}$

# 3.2. Vacuum-assisted AGMD module model

The performance modelling of the commercial V- AGMD module (i.e., Aquastill AS26 module) is based on the statistical model developed by Andres- Manas et al. [32] using the AS26 module steady- state operation. The AS26 module was characterized experimentally by Andres- Manas et al. at a pilot scale for feed salinity up to  $245.5\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{L}$  and then a validated performance model was developed [32]. This model allows to predict the permeate flux ( $J_{MD}$  in  $\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{m}^2\cdot \mathrm{hr}$ ) and preheated feed brine outlet stream (14, Fig. 1) temperature ( $T_{c}^{out}$ ) using experimentally determined correlations given by Eq. (7) and Eq. (8). The average relative errors for the  $\dot{J}_{MD}$  and  $T_{c}^{out}$ , when the experimental data compared with data computed by using the developed correlations, are about  $4.2\%$  and  $0.1\%$  respectively. Thus, as can be seen from these average relative errors, these correlations yield acceptable deviations. The model validation is carried out for a range of operating conditions:  $S_{f}$  of  $35.1 - 245.5\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{L}$

$\dot{V}_f^{MD}$  of  $400 - 1100\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{h}$ ,  $T_{c}^{in}$  of  $20 - 30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , and  $T_{h}^{in}$  of  $60 - 80^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  [32].

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & J_{MD} = 0.48 + 0.006\bullet T_h^{in} - 0.0014\bullet \dot{V}_f^{MD} - 0.029\cdot T_c^{in} + 0.0014\cdot S_f\\ & \quad +5.3\cdot 10^{-5}\bullet T_h^{in}\bullet \dot{V}_f^{MD} - 1\cdot 10^{-4}\bullet T_h^{in}\bullet S_f - 5\cdot 10^{-6}\cdot \dot{V}_f^{MD}\cdot S_f\\ & \quad +1.16\cdot 10^{-5}\cdot S^2 \end{array} \tag{3}
$$

where  $T_{h}^{in}$  and  $T_{c}^{in}$  are the evaporator and condenser channels inlet temperatures  $(^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  respectively,  $S_{f}$  is the feed salinity  $(\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{L})$  and  $\dot{V}_f^{MD}$  is the MD module feed flow rate (stream  $12\rightarrow 13\rightarrow 14\rightarrow 15,\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{h}$  in Fig. 1).

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & T_{f}^{out} = 3.5 + 0.916\bullet T_{h}^{in} - 0.0047\bullet \dot{V}_{f}^{MD} + 0.035\cdot T_{c}^{in} - 0.01\cdot S_{f}\\ & \quad +8\cdot 10^{-5}\cdot T_{c}^{in}\cdot V_{f}^{MD} \end{array} \tag{8}
$$

The produced permeate water  $(\dot{m}_p^{MD}$  in  $\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{s})$  and specific thermal energy consumption of the MD module  $(STE C_{MD}$  in  $\mathrm{kWhth} / \mathrm{m}^3$  of produced permeate water) are given by Eq. (9) and Eq. (10), respectively.

$$
\dot{m}_p^{MD} = \left(\frac{1}{3.6\times 10^6}\right)\dot{J}_{MD}\cdot A_{MD}\cdot \rho_p \tag{9}
$$

where  $A_{MD}$  is the membrane area  $(\mathrm{m}^2)$  and  $\rho_{p}$  is the permeate density  $(\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^3)$

$$
STEC_{MD} = \left(\frac{1}{3.6\times 10^3}\right)\left(\frac{\dot{V}_f^{MD}\cdot C_{Pf}\cdot\rho_f\cdot(T_h^{in} - T_c^{out})}{\dot{J}_{MD}\cdot A_{MD}}\right) \tag{10}
$$

where  $C_{Pf}$  and  $\rho_{f}$  are the feed brine specific heat capacity  $(\mathrm{kJ} / \mathrm{kg}\cdot^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  and density  $(\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^3)$ , respectively, as a function of  $S_{f}$  and  $T_{h}^{in}$

The gained output ratio (GOR) and single- pass permeate water recovery ratio of the MD module  $(RR_{MD}^{ss})$  are given by Eq. (11) and Eq. (12).

$$
GOR = \dot{\eta}_{p}^{fg}\frac{\dot{J}_{MD}\cdot A_{MD}\cdot\rho_p}{\dot{V}_f^{MD}\cdot C_{Pf}\cdot\rho_f\cdot(T_h^{in} - T_c^{out})} \tag{11}
$$

where  $h_{p}^{fg}$  is the latent heat of the permeate  $(\mathrm{kJ} / \mathrm{kg})$

$$
RR_{MD}^{ss} = \frac{\dot{m}_p^{MD}}{\dot{V}_f^{MD}\cdot\rho_f} \tag{12}
$$

The overall thermal efficiency of the membrane  $(\eta_{th}^{MD})$  is defined as [41]:

$$
\eta_{th}^{MD} = \frac{\dot{J}_{MD}\cdot A_{MD}\cdot\rho_p\cdot h_p^{fg}}{\dot{V}_f^{MD}\cdot\rho_f\cdot C_{Pf}\cdot(T_c^{out} - T_c^{in})} \tag{13}
$$

The brine properties are obtained using the correlations of Nayar

et al. [39] and Sharqawy et al. [42]. The electrical power consumption of the MD module's CP  $(\dot{W}_{cp,el}^{MD}$  in kW) is calculated by:

$$
\dot{W}_{cp,el}^{MD} = \left(\frac{1}{n_p}\right)\frac{\dot{m}_f^{MD}\cdot\Delta P_f^{MD}}{\rho_f} \tag{14}
$$

where  $\dot{m}_f^{MD}$  and  $\Delta P_f^{MD}$  are the mass flow rate and pressure drop of the MD module brine feed stream.

# 3.3. AHP cycle model

The AHP model is based on mass and energy conservation laws applied in each component and the overall heat pump cycle. Moreover, the 2nd Law of thermodynamics is ensured in each heat pump component model. The correlations of  $\mathrm{NH_3 / H_2O}$  mixture properties were taken from Tillner- Roth and Friend [43] while properties of water used as an external heat carrier loop were calculated from the IAPWS- IF95 values. The following commonly used AHP cycle modelling assumptions are made [44]:  $\bullet$  steady- state conditions are considered;  $\bullet$  pressure drops and fluid leakage in pipelines are neglected;  $\bullet$  potential and kinetic energy effects are neglected;  $\bullet$  no heat losses to the environment;  $\bullet$  liquid solution leaving the absorber and desorber are at saturated state at their corresponding temperature and pressure;  $\bullet$  the liquid refrigerant leaving the condenser is saturated;  $\bullet$  partial vaporization is allowed in the evaporator with fixed temperature glide;  $\bullet$  the expansion processes in the solution and refrigerant expansion valves are isenthalpic;  $\bullet$  the rectified vapour and liquid reflux leaving the rectifier are saturated;  $\bullet$  the solution and refrigerant heat exchangers have a constant effectiveness value;  $\bullet$  the solution pump has constant isentropic efficiency (70  $\%$

The AHP performance is evaluated using the coefficient of performance  $(COP_{shc})$  and exergy efficiency  $(eCOP_{shc})$  defined for simultaneous heating and cooling supplies and given by Eqs. (15) and (16).

$$
COP_{shc} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{con} + \dot{Q}_{eva}}{\dot{Q}_{des}} \tag{15}
$$

where  $\dot{Q}_{con}$ ,  $\dot{Q}_{des}$ , and  $\dot{Q}_{eva}$  are heat flow rates  $(\mathrm{kW})$  of condenser, desorber, and evaporator, respectively.

$$
eCOP_{shc} = \frac{\dot{Q}_{con}\cdot\left|\left(1 - \frac{T_0}{T_{con}}\right)\right| + \dot{Q}_{eva}\cdot\left|\left(1 - \frac{T_0}{T_{eva}}\right)\right|}{\dot{Q}_{des}\cdot\left|\left(1 - \frac{T_0}{T_{des}}\right)\right| + \dot{W}_{sp}} \tag{16}
$$

where  $\overline{T}_{con}$ ,  $\overline{T}_{des}$ , and  $\overline{T}_{eva}$  are the entropic average temperatures of the external heat transfer loop of the condenser (stream  $20\rightarrow 21$ ), desorber (stream  $30\rightarrow 31$ ) and evaporator (stream  $26\rightarrow 27$ ) shown in Fig. 3, respectively,  $T_{0}$  is the dead state temperature taken as  $298.15\mathrm{K}(25^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  in this study, and  $\dot{W}_{sp}$  is the electrical power  $(\mathrm{kW})$  consumed by the solution pump.

# 3.4. ST subsystem modelling

The solar thermal power,  $\dot{Q}_{sol,us}$  produced by the PTC solar field (comprising the T160 collectors from the Absolicon solar AB) is determined by applying the quasi- dynamic model:

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\frac{\dot{Q}_{sol,ul}}{A_{sol}} = \eta_{0,b}\cdot (K_{\theta b}(\theta_L,\theta_T)\cdot G_b + K_{\theta b}\cdot G_d) - c_1(t_m - t_a) - c_2(t_m - t_a)^2}\\ & {\qquad -c_3\cdot u(t_m - t_a) + c_4(E_L - \sigma T_a^4) - c_5\frac{dt_m}{dt} -c_6\cdot u\cdot G} \end{array} \tag{17}
$$

where  $A_{sol}$  is the solar collector area  $(\mathbf{m}^2)$ ;  $\eta_{0,b}$  is the optical (zero loss) efficiency of the collector for beam radiation, at a normal incidence angle  $(- )$ ;  $\theta_{L}$  and  $\theta_{T}$  are the biaxial incidence angles for beam radiation onto the collector plane in longitudinal  $(L)$  and transversal  $(T)$  direction from the normal  $[\circ ]$ ;  $G_{b}$  the direct beam solar radiation in the collector plane  $(\mathrm{W / m^2})$ ;  $G_{d}$  the diffuse solar radiation in the collector plane;  $K_{\theta b}(\theta_L,\theta_T)$  incidence angle modifier (IAM) for beam solar radiation  $(- )$ , this can be expressed as  $K_{\theta b}(\theta_L,\theta_T) = K_{\theta b}(\theta_L)\cdot K_{\theta b}(\theta_T)$  and  $K_{\theta b}(\theta_T) = 1.0$  for collector tracking the sun with the tracking axis aligned north to south;  $K_{\theta d}$  is the IAM for diffuse solar radiation  $(- )$ , is a collector constant;  $c_{1} - c_{6}$  are the solar collector constants  $(- )$ ;  $u$  the wind speed  $(\mathrm{m / s})$ ,  $E_{L}$  the long wavelength radiation  $(\mathrm{W / m^2})$ , and  $\sigma$  is the Stefan- Boltzmann constant  $(5.67\bullet 10^{- 8}\mathrm{W / m^2K^4})$ ;  $t_{m}$  is the mean PTC fluid temperature;  $t_{a}$  is the ambient air temperature close to the collector.  $K_{\theta b}(\theta_L)$  is calculated using Eq. (18) and the coefficients of Eq. (17) and Eq. (18) for the T160 solar collector are listed in Table 1. The IAM for beam radiation (i.e.,  $K_{\theta b}(\theta_L)$  in Eq. (18)) in the collector test incidence angle values are also given in the Solar Keymark test report [45].

$$
K_{\theta b}(\theta_L) = 1 - b_0\left(\frac{1}{\cos\theta_L} -1\right) \tag{18}
$$

where  $b_{0}$  is the incidence angle modifier coefficient  $(- )$ .

The useful heat rate from the PTC solar field  $(\dot{Q}_{sol,ul}$  in kW) can be calculated using:

$$
\dot{Q}_{sol,ul} = \dot{m}_{sol}\cdot Cp_{sol}\cdot (t_{34} - t_{33}) \tag{19}
$$

where  $\dot{m}_{sol}$  is the mass flow rate  $(\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{s})$  of the primary solar loop (stream  $32\rightarrow 33\rightarrow 34$ , Fig. 1),  $Cp_{sol}$  is the specific heat capacity of water at collector mean temperature,  $t_{33} / t_{34}$  are the inlet/outlet temperatures (streams 33/34) of the PTC solar field.

The thermal efficiency of the PTC solar field  $(\eta_{col,th})$  is defined as:

$$
\eta_{col,th} = \frac{\int\dot{Q}_{sol,u}}{A_{sol}\cdot\int G_b} \tag{20}
$$

where  $G_{b}$  is the direct beam radiation  $(\mathrm{kW} / \mathrm{m}^2)$ .

The storage tank simulation is based on mixing zones modelling by dividing the tank volume into zones with an assumed uniform temperature level. The electrical power consumed by the ST subsystem's circulation pumps (CP1 and CP2),  $\dot{W}_{cp1,el}^{ST}$  and  $\dot{W}_{cp2,el}^{ST}$ , are calculated as:

$$
\dot{W}_{cp1,el}^{ST} = \left(\frac{1}{\eta_{cp1}^{ST}}\right)\frac{\dot{m}_{sol}\cdot(P_{33} - P_{32})}{\rho_{32}}\mathrm{and}\dot{W}_{cp2,el}^{ST} = \left(\frac{1}{\eta_{cp2}^{ST}}\right)\frac{\dot{m}_{36}\cdot(P_{30} - P_{36})}{\rho_{36}} \tag{16}
$$

where  $\eta_{cp1}^{ST}$  and  $\eta_{cp2}^{ST}$  are the CP1 and CP2 efficiency,  $(P_{33} - P_{32})$  and  $(P_{30} - P_{36})$  is the pressure rise by the pumps,  $\rho_{32}$  and  $\rho_{36}$  the density of water at the inlet of CP1 and CP2 (streams 32 and stream 36), and  $\dot{m}_{36}$  is the mass flow rate  $(\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{s})$  of the secondary water loop (stream  $35\rightarrow 36\rightarrow 36\rightarrow 31$ ). The pressure drops in the PTC collector,  $\Delta P_{col}$  in mbar at  $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , is calculated by Ref. [46]:

$$
\Delta P_{col} = 14.334\cdot \dot{V}_{col}^{2} + 8.260\cdot \dot{V}_{col} \tag{22}
$$

where  $\dot{V}_{col}$  is the heat transfer fluid (water) flow rate in  $\mathrm{m^3 / h}$

The secondary loop of the ST subsystem is heated to the desired temperature  $(t_{36} = t_{AH,set}$  Fig. 1) using an auxiliary heater when the available solar energy is inadequate  $(t_{36}< t_{AH,set})$  . The amount of heat delivered to the desorber of the absorption heat pump via the auxiliary heater,  $\dot{Q}_{AH}$  in kW, is given by:

$$
\dot{Q}_{AH} = \eta_{AH}\cdot \dot{m}_{sf}\cdot LHV_{fuel} - UA_{AH}\cdot (t_{AF} - t_{a}) = \dot{m}_{sf}\cdot Cp_{sf}\cdot (t_{AH,set} - t_{35}) \tag{23}
$$

where  $\eta_{AH}$  and  $UA_{AH}$  are the auxiliary heater's thermal efficiency  $(- )$  and heat loss coefficient  $(\mathrm{kW / K})$

The solar fraction (SF) of the ST- AHP- MD system with an auxiliary heater is defined as:

$$
SF = 1 - \frac{\int\dot{Q}_{AH}}{\int\dot{Q}_{des}} \tag{24}
$$

where the  $\dot{Q}_{des}$  is the driving heat consumed by the absorption heat pump (i.e. desorber heat rate,  $\dot{Q}_{des}$  ). The dynamic simulation of the STAHP system was carried out using TRNSYS software [47], and details of the system's component TRNSYS model (type) are given in Appendix A. The weather data of Almeria (Spain), from the EnergyPlus database [48], were used in this study. A simulation time step of  $5\mathrm{min}$  and convergence tolerance of 0.001 were set during the system simulation performed for  $8760\mathrm{h}$  of the year.

The proposed solar- powered AHP- MD- RO system input modelling parameters and operating conditions at the reference case, and their variation ranges for the parametric analysis, are listed in Table 2.

# 4.1. RO-MD desalination subsystem

The small- scale RO desalination plant process  $(100\mathrm{m^3 / day}$  freshwater production capacity) is operating at a recovery rate,  $RR_{RO}$  of43.0  $\%$  with  $SEC_{RO}$  of about  $2.316\mathrm{kWh / m^3}$  in the reference case considered for Almeria (Spain). The corresponding electrical power consumed by the RO plant process,  $\dot{W}_{tot,el}^{RO}$  calculated using Eq. (4), is  $\sim 9.65\mathrm{kW_{el}}$  Besides, there is additional energy consumption for pre- treatment (0.65  $\mathrm{kWh / m^3}$  and post- treatment, which is often neglected in contrast to other energy consumption, processes of the RO desalination plant [52, 55]. The required RO plant feed pressure is  $\sim 66.1$  bar. The amount of brine concentrate rejected by the RO plant is  $126\mathrm{m^3 / day}$  which is fed to the brine storage tank. The feed seawater temperature (stream 1, Fig. 1) has a significant impact on the design of the RO plant feed pressure (HPP) and membrane performance [56]. For instance, the osmotic pressure increased from 53.3 bar to 57.9 bar when seawater temperature increased from  $15^{\circ}C$  to  $40^{\circ}C$  at  $40~\mathrm{g / kg}$  of salinity. The HPP required for the SWRO plant is typically reduced linearly by  $5 - 8\%$  for every  $10^{\circ}C$  rise in the feed temperature (from  $12^{\circ}C$  to  $40^{\circ}C$  [56].

The single- pass MD system performance using the Aquastill AS26 AGMD module is depicted in Fig. 5 for feed brine salinity up to saturation. The performance parameters (permeate flow rate  $\dot{V}_{p}^{MD}$  , recovery ratio  $RR_{MD}^{ss}$ $GOR$  and  $STE C_{MD}$  ) were obtained based on  $J_{MD}$  and  $T_{c}^{out}$  computed using the correlations given by Eq. (7) and Eq. (8), respectively. The values of  $J_{MD}$  is reduces from  $2.676\mathrm{L / h}\cdot \mathrm{m}^2$  to  $0.860\mathrm{L / h}\cdot \mathrm{m}^2$  and  $T_{c}^{out}$  slightly decreases from  $73.4^{\circ}C$  to  $72.1^{\circ}C$  when the feed salinity increased from  $70~\mathrm{g / kg}$  to  $260~\mathrm{g / kg}$

In Fig. 6 (a), the overall thermal efficiency of the membrane  $(\dot{Q}_{th}^{MD})$  calculated using Eq. (13), and feed preheating rate in the condenser/ cooling channels  $(\dot{Q}_{con}^{MD})$  are shown for the MD system operated with a single pass of the feed brine. The  $\eta_{th}^{MD}$  and  $\dot{Q}_{con}^{MD}$  are obtained at the feed flow rate of  $1100\mathrm{L / h}$  and  $25.92\mathrm{m}^2$  membrane area. The external heat input rate  $(\dot{Q}_{hxt}^{MD})$  and required cooling input rate  $(\dot{Q}_{hx2}^{MD})$  to cool down the brine reject, to  $20^{\circ}C_{\cdot}$  of the MD system per single pass of the feed brine are depicted in Fig. 6 (b). The required flow rate of the MD system's driving hot water (stream  $21\rightarrow 20$  HX1, Fig.1) at  $85^{\circ}C$  per single- pass of feed brine solution  $(1100\mathrm{L / h})$  , is reduced from around  $1292.3\mathrm{L / h}$  to  $1032.3\mathrm{L / h}$  when the salinity increased from  $70~\mathrm{g / kg}$  to  $260~\mathrm{g / kg}$  .While the flow rate of chilled water (i.e., stream  $22\rightarrow 23$  HX2, Fig.1) at  $16^{\circ}C$  is between about  $1052.3\mathrm{L / h}$  and  $1275.7\mathrm{L / h}$  with the maximum flow rate at  $190\mathrm{- }195\mathrm{g / kg}$  of salinity. The electrical power consumed by the feed pump of the MD subsystem, per single pass, is increased from 0.017 kW to  $0.020\mathrm{kW}$  when the salinity increased from  $70~\mathrm{g / kg}$  to  $260~\mathrm{g / kg}$

The MD subsystem's performance and operating parameters in batch mode of operation are defined and presented in Table 3. The instantaneous performance of the MD system is captured by using the developed steady- state model of the commercial V- AGMD module in Section 3.2, and the simulated performance at instantaneous feed salinity is depicted in Figs. 5 and 6. It is supposed that the external brine feed tank is large enough so that the rate of change in salinity is slow during the system operation. The required total cycle time for a batch operation  $(\tau_{batch})$  , i. e., from the feed solution salinity of  $Sal_{f} = 70\mathrm{g / kg}$  way up to saturation at  $Sal_{b} = 260\mathrm{g / kg},$  is evaluated using Eq. (25). The average permeate flux,  $GOR$  and STEC  $(\overline{J}_{MD},\overline{GOR},$  and STEC, respectively) given in Table 3 are independent of the initial mass of the feed brine solution  $(M_{MD,f}^{total})$  thereby, they are independent of the feed tank volume. The external driving heat input and cooling input rates  $(\overline{Q_h}$  and  $\overline{Q_c}$  , respectively) are also independent of the size of the feed tank volume. However, large feed tank volume is supposed for the quasi- steady approximation made

during the batch operation of the MD subsystem and the impact of transients between the batch operations can be neglected. Also, the hydrophobic membrane wetting phenomena and scaling with the use of high salinity feeds  $(70 - 260\mathrm{g / kg})$  should be investigated for the long- term operation of the MD subsystem as an RO brine concentrator. Consequently, there are various methods proposed in the literature for pre- treating brine rejects of seawater RO plants including the use of antiscalant, chemical deposition combined with ultrafiltration (UF), and nanofiltration (NF) [57]. Thus, it has been shown that the problem of scaling with high salinity feeds can be prevented using, e.g., antiscalants for an air- gap MD system under lab- and pilot- scale operations [57].

The MD subsystem performance for the concentration of the RO plant's reject (i.e.,  $120\mathrm{m}^3 /\mathrm{day}$  at  $70\mathrm{g / kg}$  salinity) is presented in Table 4. At the reference conditions listed in Table 1 and per batch operation of the MD modules, the system delivers around  $97.9\mathrm{m}^3$  of desalinated water with around  $29.8\mathrm{m}^3$  of concentrated brine reject at  $260\mathrm{g / kg}$  of salinity and  $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The required number of the V- AGMD modules (i.e., 83) was estimated based on the average permeate flux of  $\sim 1.909\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{h}\cdot \mathrm{m}^2$  while the minimum required module number (59) corresponds to the maximum permeate flux  $(2.676\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{h}\cdot \mathrm{m}^2)$ . The MD subsystem operates at an average GOR of 3.888 and STEC of  $169\mathrm{kWh} / \mathrm{m}^3$  over the cycle time (i.e.,  $\tau_{\mathrm{batch}} = 23.6\mathrm{h}$ ). The heating and cooling consumed by the MD subsystem are  $16.54\mathrm{MWh}$  and  $13.47\mathrm{MWh}$ , respectively at an average heating and cooling input rates of  $701.6\mathrm{kW}$  and  $571.2\mathrm{kW}$  supplied by the integrated heat pump.

# 4.2. AHP performance

The solar- powered  $\mathrm{NH_3 / H_2O}$  AHP is integrated into an MD subsystem as illustrated in Fig. 1 for the supply of simultaneous heating and cooling demand of the MD system. Thereby, computed performance parameters of the AHP during the simultaneous heating and cooling supplies  $(COP_{shc}$  and  $eCOP_{shc})$  at reference conditions (Table 2) are presented in Fig. 7 (a) and 7 (b).

The AHP cycle is designed to provide the required heating rate  $(\dot{Q}_h)$  for the MD subsystem, which is  $701.63\mathrm{kW}$  at a hot water supply temperature  $(t_{21})$  of  $85^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The simultaneous cooling output  $(\dot{Q}_c)$  of the AHP cycle was  $857.86\mathrm{kW}$  at a chilled water supply temperature  $(t_{27})$  of  $16^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and around  $67\%$  of this cooling output is used for cooling down the MD brine reject to  $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  before returning to the brine storage tank (stream  $16\rightarrow 17$ , Fig. 1). The remaining cooling output (i.e.,  $286.69\mathrm{kW}$ ) is available for space cooling applications (stream  $24\rightarrow 25$ ). The AHP's stream properties at the reference conditions, given in Table 2, and the driving heat temperature  $(t_{30})$  corresponding to the optimum performance are presented in Table 5. The AHP cycle operates at high- and low- pressure levels of 49.98 and 6.81 bar.

The effect of driving heat source temperature  $(t_{30}$ , between  $120^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and  $160^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ) on the desorber and absorber heat transfer rates are also illustrated in Fig. 8(a) and (b), respectively, at several absorber's cooling water inlet temperatures (i.e.,  $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ,  $25^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ,  $30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , and  $35^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ). The AHP operates at high performance  $(COP_{shc} = 1.273$  and  $eCOP_{shc} = 0.40$ , at a driving heat of  $135^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ) when seawater at  $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  is used as the absorber's

heat rejection medium (stream  $28 \rightarrow 29$ , Fig. 1). The  $\mathrm{NH_3}$  mass fraction difference across the solution field of the AHP cycle  $(\Delta z = z_s - z_w)$  is  $0.1275 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{kg}$  with strong (basic) and weak, in  $\mathrm{NH_3}$ , solution mass fractions of  $0.7153 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{kg}$  and  $0.5878 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{kg}$ , respectively. The power consumed by the solution pump is about  $23.31 \mathrm{kW}$  at the considered reference condition.

# 4.3. Annual performance analysis

The ST- AHP- MD system's annual performance was simulated considering different sizes of the ST field to reach at least  $20\%$  solar fraction each month of the year using Almería (Spain) weather data. Fig. 9 depicts the effect of ST field aperture area on the solar fraction, calculated using Eq. (24), during the whole year. The yearly solar fraction is  $\sim 22.3\%$  for  $990 \mathrm{~m}^2$ ,  $32.2\%$  for  $1980 \mathrm{~m}^2$ ,  $42.1\%$  for  $3025 \mathrm{~m}^2$ , and  $50.7\%$  for  $4015 \mathrm{~m}^2$ .

The produced useful heat by the ST field is about 1120 MWh/year, 2209.07 MWh/year, 3301.19 MWh/year, and 4270 MWh/year for the considered ST field aperture area of  $990 \mathrm{~m}^2$ ,  $1980 \mathrm{~m}^2$ ,  $3025 \mathrm{~m}^2$ , and  $4015 \mathrm{~m}^2$ , respectively. There are 10 solar PTC collectors per row in each simulated ST field. The yearly thermal efficiency of the PTC collectors, calculated using Eq. (20), is about  $63.9\%$  for  $990 \mathrm{~m}^2$ ,  $63\%$  for  $1980 \mathrm{~m}^2$ ,  $61.6\%$  for  $3025 \mathrm{~m}^2$ , and  $60.1\%$  for  $4015 \mathrm{~m}^2$ . The yearly available direct beam, sky diffuse, and ground- reflected diffuse solar radiation on the collector surface is  $1770.49 \mathrm{kWh} / \mathrm{m}^2$ ,  $606.25 \mathrm{kWh} / \mathrm{m}^2$ , and  $42.89 \mathrm{kWh} / \mathrm{m}^2$ , respectively; and their monthly variation along the year is given in Fig. 10. The annual average, minimum, and maximum ambient air temperatures  $(t_{\mathrm{avg}}, t_{\mathrm{avg}}$ , and  $t_{\mathrm{max}})$  are  $18.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ,  $2.8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ , and  $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ; and their variation also shown in Fig. 10.

Based on the simulated ST- AHP- MD system performance (Fig. 9), the ST field with an aperture area of  $1980 \mathrm{~m}^2$  (i.e. 360 Absolicon T160 collectors) was considered as a reference case to attain a minimum of  $20\%$  solar fraction every month of the year. The system's solar fraction, computed using Eq. (24), varied between  $\sim 19.8\%$  (December) and  $43.6\%$  (July) for the  $1980 \mathrm{~m}^2$  ST field aperture area. The ST field's produced useful heat and thermal efficiency, output heat of the auxiliary heater, and desorber heat input (i.e. AHP driving heat input) are presented for each month of the year in Fig. 11. The delivered heat by the ST field is between  $72.25 \mathrm{MWh}$  (December) and  $309 \mathrm{MWh}$  (July) with thermal efficiency in the range of  $52.5\%$  (December) to  $66.4\%$  (July). The direct beam radiation is in the range of  $69.52 \mathrm{kWh} / \mathrm{m}^2$  (December) and  $234.86 \mathrm{kWh} / \mathrm{m}^2$  (July). The auxiliary heater provided about  $7161.1 \mathrm{kWh}$  year of heat to complement the heat supplied by the PTC solar collectors. Thus, the driving heat supplied to the AHP is  $10561.6 \mathrm{MWh} / \mathrm{year}$ . The primary (solar) loop circulation pump (CP1, Fig. 1) is controlled during the system operation using a hysteresis controller that uses the ST field inlet and outlet temperatures and the thermal storage tank top outlet temperature to monitor for a high cut- off limit (details given in Appendix A). The secondary loop circulation pump (CP2) and auxiliary heater operation are controlled based on the AHP operation schedule.

The heating and cooling outputs of the AHP are depicted in Fig. 12 for each month throughout the year. The temperature range of seawater used as the absorber heat rejection medium (stream 28, Fig. 3 (a)) is also shown in Fig. 12 (SW min and SW max values [58]). The AHP provided about  $6146.28 \mathrm{MWh} / \mathrm{year}$  of heating and  $7514.85 \mathrm{MWh} / \mathrm{year}$  of cooling simultaneously with  $21 \mathrm{~h} / \mathrm{d}$  of operational schedule ( $\sim 88\%$  yearly plant availability). The calculated combined COP of the AHP, using Eq. (15), is between  $1.201$  (August) and  $1.371$  (February).

Since the AHP cycle is designed to deliver the required heat of the MD subsystem all the heat pump's heating output is utilized to desalt the RO brine reject (i.e., the heating output shown in Fig. 12 is used by the MD brine concentrator). The MD brine concentrator's cooling need is also provided by part of the co- produced cooling output of the AHP (67\% of the cooling output is consumed by the MD brine concentrator). The annual produced permeate and remaining cooling output (which may be used for space cooling applications) of the proposed system are given monthly in Fig. 13. The MD brine concentrator produced  $31260.43 \mathrm{~m}^3 /$  year of desalinated water and rejected brine concentrate of  $9517.38 \mathrm{~m}^3 /$  year (at  $260 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$  of salinity).

# 5. Conclusions

A solar- powered  $\mathrm{NH_3} / \mathrm{H_2O}$  absorption heat pump (AHP)- membrane distillation (MD) system concept was proposed and investigated for RO brine reject management and space cooling applications. The AHP- MD system is used to concentrate rejected brine of an RO desalination plant with  $100 \mathrm{~m}^3 /$  day capacity from  $70 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$  to  $260 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$  of salinity. The employed MD system is based on commercial vacuum- assisted air gap membrane distillation modules (V- AGMD) with feed recirculation in

water and chilled water at  $85^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and  $16^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  simultaneously. The AHP heating capacity is  $701.63\mathrm{kW}$ , and its co- produced cooling capacity is about  $857.86\mathrm{kW}$  of which  $\sim 67\%$  is used for cooling down the MD system's brine reject to the feed storage tank temperature  $(20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ . The AHP operates at a thermal combined COP  $(COP_{shc})$  and exergy COP  $(eCOP_{shc})$  of 1.273 and 0.40, respectively, when the AHP is driven by hot water at  $135^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and absorber heat rejection medium (seawater) temperature of  $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The proposed solar- powered AHP- MD system with an auxiliary heater operates at a monthly solar fraction between  $\sim 19.8\%$  (December) and  $43.6\%$  (July) for a considered solar field aperture area of  $1980~\mathrm{m^2}$  using Almería (Spain) weather conditions. The system produced about  $31260.43\mathrm{m^3 / year}$  of desalinated water (and rejected brine concentrate of about  $9517.38\mathrm{m^3 / year}$  at  $260\mathrm{g / kg}$  of salinity) and 2511.40 MWh/year of cooling energy for space cooling applications. In summary, the development of small- scale solar- powered AHP- MD systems for RO desalination plant brine management (for both coastal and inland desalination facilities) contributes towards the development of sustainable zero liquid discharge (ZLD) or minimal liquid discharge
