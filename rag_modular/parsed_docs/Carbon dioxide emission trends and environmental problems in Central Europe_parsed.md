**Abstract:** In this research, the effect of CO₂ emission was measured in two different land-use types (Crop and Grassland) in Central European and V4 countries. The primary aim of this study is to identify the significant output of CO₂ emissions from cropland and grassland. Secondary data collected from FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) between 2010 and 2017. Mann-Whitney U test and odds ratio used to study the differences between the two country groups, and Principal Component Analysis was applied to create a performance map regarding the emission. A General Additive Panel model has analyzed the influence of area sizes and the regional differences on emissions. Results showed that the effect of grassland size is the primary factor in CO₂ emission. A significant difference can only be found between CEU and V4 countries regarding grassland size effect on CO₂ emission under grassland, which was rather small in the case of the V4 group but explained a larger part of the variance in case of CEU countries. The odds of having higher CO₂ from cropland to grassland was 2.43 times in the case of V4 compared to CEU countries.

## INTRODUCTION

On the other hand, the Earth’s total carbon content is approximately 0.8 X 10²³ grams or 80 million petagrams (Pg), where 1 Pg is equivalent to 10¹⁵ g that represents 1 gigaton (GT) (Allison, 2016). Over the past 200 years, worldwide terrestrial carbon stocks like soils, plants, animals have received significant attention because they are known to be the largest source of CO₂ in the atmosphere (Houghton et al., 1983). The primary greenhouse gas to contribute to global warming is carbon dioxide (CO₂) (Pao & Tsai, 2011). This gas is produced in soils by roots, soil organisms and through soil respiration process and efflux, and emit to the environment. The estimated average of global CO₂ flux emission from soils that affects the ozone layer and the earth’s climate based on extrapolations from biome land areas is (±S.D.) 68±4 PgC/year (Raich & Schlesinger, 1992).

But global agricultural production already has multiplied since 1970. At present, agriculture and land-use shifting are liable for 1/4 of human activities that are responsible for greenhouse gas emissions (Bennetzen et al., 2016). On the other hand, crop productivity is linked to the atmospheric.

## Section 7.8: Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Agriculture

Pollution of pesticides, CO₂ and other GHG gas emissions, whereas the soil organic matter loss can reduce the carbon sequestration potential of the environment. Generally, direct energy inputs such as diesel fuel, energy, solid fuels and other energy sources and indirect energy sources such as the agricultural manufacturing sector for the production and transportation of fertilizers, pesticides and equipment generate CO₂. Carbon dioxide emissions add to the radiative driving of Earth’s changing climate by raising the temperature of its atmosphere. Crop yield and production accounts for almost 50 per cent of human activities generates CH₄ emissions and approximately 70 per cent of anthropogenic N₂O emissions but the global warming potential of these two gases is comparatively intense, while CO₂ emissions surpass both CH₄ and N₂O. Over the past century, CO₂ contributed about 65 per cent of the combined thermodynamic effects of perennial gases; respectively, CH₄ and N₂O have added about 20 and 5 per cent.

A significant source of uncertainty in grasslands is the soil management effects on greenhouse gas emissions level. Temperate grasslands make up 20 per cent of Europe’s land area with carbon. Carbon concentration occurs mainly underground in grassland ecosystems and the changes in land use can impact on soil organic carbon stocks such as the conversion of arable land to grassland and its management. The organic matter consists of both organic inputs and soil organic matter. Organic contaminants to the soil consist of debris above and below ground including dead leaves, fallen rotten fruits, tree’s roots and branches that maintain tissue structure, crop residues, mulches, green and animal manures, fertilizer, animals dead body and waste. Those are responsible for producing gases and ultimately affect the environment. For sustaining the consistency of the soil and its future production efficiency, soil organic matter plays a crucial role. Over the years, nearly half of the world’s fertile soils have consequently deteriorated in organic matter and surface content. Tillage is dominantly responsible for the declension of agricultural soil, that accelerates organic soil decomposition. This decomposition process reduces the soil’s water retention and nutrients absorption ability, which minimizes the infiltration capacity of rainfall and contributes to increased soil consolidation and biodiversity loss. Such agricultural soils cannot leverage environmental resources such as freshwater, carbon sequestration and erosion management and pest control.

Over the past few decades, the EU has focused on the possible minimization of environmental pollution through organic cultivation system because it consumes lower energy for production from 10 to 70 % for a unit of land (G.J./ha) and from 15 to 45 % per yield (G.J./t). However, organic cultivation requires more land than the conventional and the EU is the most active participant to CO₂ emission cuts under the Kyoto Protocol as the European countries carry out model initiatives in order to mitigate global warming. On February 16 in 2005 the 37 most industrialized countries of the 146 nations joined under the Kyoto Protocol of the “United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change” (UNFCCC) to minimize their GHG emissions and contributing to limit CO₂-equivalent emissions. The Kyoto Protocol allows reductions in emissions of 6 ‘greenhouse’ gases including carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). This calculates the ‘global warming potential’ (GWP) indices for each gas.

In this study, twelve European countries were selected to investigate the effects of the most toxic greenhouse gas and to understand the environmental influence and divergent views regarding CO₂ emission. Two different land types - cropland and grassland - have been involved in the research. The twelve countries are Austria, Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Switzerland and all have different obligations to reduce CO₂ emissions.

Apart from that most of the central European countries signed the Kyoto Protocol, the Visegrád (V4) group including the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia was established to work together to develop geographically, socially and politically. They have a long shared common ground in tradition, culture, religion, and politics. In the European strategy for 2020 Visegrád group countries focused on five key priorities and among them Climate change and energy objectives got significant attention to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared to 1990 levels; to raise the share of renewables in the ultimate electricity usage to 20% and to increase energy efficiency by 20%.

Green House Gas (GHG) emission from agriculture and forestry are the leading causes of affecting the environment. Especially land degradation, erosion, additional water consumption in cultivation, organic matter loss and greenhouse gas emissions. Particularly the integrated emission of CO₂ negatively affects both cropland and grassland of Central European and the V4 group. This study’s primary purpose is to measure the CO₂ emission of 12 central European countries’ cropland and grassland and the extent of influence on the environment that fuels global warming.

The subject of this paper to answer the question: how do carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions affect the central European countries environment? To answer this question, the effect of CO₂ emission was evaluated from C stock changes in above and below-ground biomass pool, dead organic matter, fires and drainage of organic soils on cropland and grassland regarding Central European and V4 group.

The primary contributions are the identification of the environmental influence and the assessment of their feasibility. In the first section of the article, a major emphasis was placed on the literature review distinguishing the present research from past studies. Secondly, advanced methodology and data analysis techniques are described. Finally, a summary of the results with probable mitigation strategies, recommendations.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

The investigation of the aggregate effect of land-based major greenhouse gas emissions was based on secondary data sources from the official database of the “Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations” (FAO). Relevant data for both country groups have been collected from FAO between 2010 and 2017 (FAOSTAT, n.d.) in order to quantify the land-based gases emitted by the Central European and the V4 group and to examine the country-specific effects for cropland and grassland in accordance with the Kyoto protocol and Europe 2020’s greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. The areas are given in hectares and the amount of CO₂ is measured in Gigagram. The amount of CO₂ emissions under cropland and grassland was converted to tonnes and divided by areas, respectively, to measure emission production in tonnes per hectare. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) performed to create a performance map of the countries regarding the studied factors. The ratio of the total production from cropland and grassland also calculated for the two country groups. Based on this perspective, the odds ratio (OR) and its 95 per cent confidence intervals calculated according to Altman (Altman, 1997).

To measure the influence of area sizes (of cropland and grassland) and the regional differences on emissions, the ratio of variance estimated by the following General Additive Panel model (GAP):

where \( y_{ij} \) denotes the emission from CO₂ for the i-th country in the j-th year, denotes the global means.

## RESULTS

The study design enabled to examine the ratio differences and comparative emission of Carbon dioxide in CEU and V4 country’s cropland and grassland between 2010 to 2017. The statistics indicate not just the individual values but the average values over the whole period (Table 1). Among the Central European countries, Germany and Poland have the most substantial areas and emissions. Slovakia, Croatia, Luxembourg have lower areas and emissions in Gigagrams. The ratio between CO₂ emission under cropland and grassland was the lowest in the case of Slovenia, Austria and Netherlands and the highest in the case of Croatia and Slovakia (Table 1). This studies explaining the changes in emissions based on land size. Slovenia, Hungary and Croatia are in the worst situation because of the highest CO₂ emission under grassland and cropland in tonnes/hectare (Table 1 and Figure 1). The Mann-Whitney rank test found significant differences between V4 and other Central European countries concerning the cropland area and emissions under cropland and grassland measured in tonnes per hectare. Visegrád group countries have a significantly larger size of cropland but relatively lower.

CO₂ emission under cropland and grassland if we consider emission in tonnes per hectare. This phenomenon can also be seen on the following performance map (Figure 1).

**Figure 1.** PCA Analysis of CO₂ emission by land type for Central European Countries.
C: Cropland; G: grassland; Source: authors’ estimations.

There is a significant difference between the two ratios (cropland versus grassland) concerning country groups (Table 2). The odds of having higher CO₂ from cropland to grassland in the case of V4 countries is 2.43 (95 % CI: 1.88 - 3.14; Z=6.78; p<0.001) times much compared to the other Central European ones. The amount of CO₂ emission under the cropland area is significantly higher compared to grassland in the V4 group than in the Central EU. The high fluctuations also observed as individual countries have different ratios. Regarding weighted CO₂ emission 31% and 20% of CO₂ amount related to grassland in the case of Austria and the Netherlands, while 99 per cent originated from cropland in the case of Croatia, Slovakia and Hungary.

The effect of grassland size is the primary factor in CO₂ emission as 98-99% of the variance explained by this effect (Table 3).

The impact of grassland size on CO₂ emission under cropland is relatively smaller in the case of the V4 group and grassland size explains only 71.3 per cent of the variance of CO₂ emission under cropland compared to other CEU countries (98.2%). On the other hand, the cropland area explained a significantly higher amount of variance (28.6%) compared to the other CEU countries. Individual country differences contributed to a less explained ratio in the variance in the case of the V4 group but in the case of CEU countries, individual country differences were relatively higher with respect to CO₂ under grassland.

**DISCUSSION**

The present study focused on CO₂ emission proportions that vary based on country-specific land use. Research results are significantly coherent with Xiaofeng Xu (2008) who developed the biogeochemical model to estimate large-scale soil CO₂ fluxes and reported that the highest slope occurred in agricultural rice production and lowest temperate on grassland. Research results showed that grassland has a relatively higher impact on the environment than cropland.

Very few related studies have been carried out for Central European and V4 countries that affect CO₂ emission at cropland and grassland level by Dorota Wawrzyniak (2020), Jiandong Chen, Ping Wang, Lianbiao Cui, Shuo Huang and Malin Song (2018), Moutinho, Victor Madaleno, Mara Inglesi-Lotz, Roula Dogan and Eyup (2018), Madaleno and Moutinho (2017), Oertel, Cornelius Matschullat, Jörg Zurba, Kamal Zimmermann, Frank Erasmi and Stefan (2016). The majority of researchers put special emphasis on cropland rather than grassland that has a significant effect on the environment but our research has shown the opposite result. This paper explores this gap and encourages further examination of the factors influencing country-specific land-based CO₂ emission in Central Europe and the Visegrád countries.

Dorota Wawrzyniak’s (2020) studies were based on data from 1993 to 2016 stating that Visegrád countries decreased their emissions by 20% achieving the Kyoto protocol and Europe 2020 target. Hungary has significantly reduced CO₂ emissions by 26% and 22% declined in the Czech Republic, 21% in Slovakia and Poland’s large land size remains the largest emitter among the V4 group reducing the CO₂ emission by 18%.

In another study, O’Connor (2020) closely observed fossil-fuel and land-use change based on CO₂ emissions from 1751 to 2018 and identified the relationship between carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions and sink processes which are responsible for climate change. Since the mid-1700s, CO₂ emissions have increased by 370% for fossil-fuel combustion.

This study shows that grassland of both CEU and V4 countries is responsible for higher CO₂ emission as 98.2%.

The reason behind the increased emission is that the emission shifts were caused by the application of organic matter decomposition. Soil greenhouse gas (CO₂, CH₄, N₂O) flux directly affects the atmosphere by increasing emission (Yashiro et al., 2008). Besides, heterotrophic bacteria can oxidize the soil’s carbon and extract CO₂ that spreads into the environment. This respiratory cycle is one of the major fluxes of carbon (C) from the atmosphere to the terrestrial ecosystems (Schlesinger, 2011). Ideal soil respiration and organic decomposition depend entirely on abiotic factors such as soil humidity and temperature (Kirschbaum, 2004). As a result, the future climate will significantly change which correlates with the research result.

According to Rebecca Ryals and Silver’s (2013) organic matter amendments, the carbon advantages of enhanced net primary productivity (NPP) can be compensated from a global warming viewpoint by reducing soil greenhouse gas emissions. Changes in organic matter maximize soil carbon and nitrogen (N) concentrations and may significantly change the soil’s environmental conditions including humidity, temperature, and pH, thus raising potential carbon dioxide (CO₂), nitrous oxide (N₂O), and methane (CH₄) emissions. Amending grassland soils with organic waste greenhouse gas emissions can mitigate (GREGORICH et al., 2005).

The results suggested complementary strategies including soil management, nitrification inhibitors, and management of organic or inorganic fertilizers that directly influence the CO₂ gas emissions (Luo et al., 2010). Also, climate change highly depends on the agriculture system, and it is the primary determinant of agriculture productivity but also fluctuates on latitude, altitude, and crop type (Adams et al., 1999). Eventually, temperature changes negatively affect overall food production and the environment. It has been estimated that agricultural activities contribute approximately 30 percent of the GHG emissions that cause anthropogenic climate change (Pete Smith & Gregory, 2013), and growth rates of the rain-fed area will be decreased by 15 percent compared to the baseline (Rosegrant et al., 2009). However, organic cultivation increases 30 percent of the higher richness of species like birds, insects, and plants compared to conventional cultivation systems, but 16% of them showed adverse biodiversity effects (Bengtsson et al., 2005).

In Europe, since the mid-1980s, policymakers, consumers, environmentalists, and farmers have focused considerable attention on organic cultivation (Stolze & Lampkin, 2009). Organic agriculture is a farming approach that represents the quality of the food and health, environmental preservation, livestock conservation, sustainable use of resources, and aims for social equality (Lampkin, 2017).

## Conclusion

In nutshell, CO₂ is the core GHGs that connected with global warming. Measurement of carbon can be a crucial strategy to monitor and control CO₂ emissions in CEU. On the other hand, the CEU and Visegrád group have their own nationally defined goals and external difficulties emerging from geographical disparities. The purpose of this research was to see how much GHG emitting by the CEU and Visegrád countries and how they are coping with GHG emission-reducing strategies in meeting the target of Kyoto protocol and Europe 2020’s environmental goals. Results reflect the countries’ different level of GHG gas emission situations, making it harder to achieve cohesion.

Present analysis and policy discussion narrowed down the climate issue to a debate about CO₂ emissions from central European and Visegrád country’s cropland and grassland. In contrast, the Kyoto and Europe 2020 Agreements contained different climate policy issues including non-CO₂ greenhouse gases.

Emission results highlight the fact that Central European and V4 group countries’ cropland is responsible for more emission than emission from grassland, and therefore cropland is likely to have a more substantial influence on climate change. It is imperative to bring this issue to the forefront of biomass pool, dead organic matter, organic soils drainage to assess the collective impact to the environmental changes, and forthcoming steps should take to explore the potential mitigation and adaptation processes to fulfil and comply with the targets of Kyoto protocol and Europe 2020 strategy that need to be achieved by 2020.

Even though some mitigation strategies can adversely affect farming systems’ adaptive ability, most climate change adaptation options have a favourable impact on mitigation. For CEU countries appropriate adaptation measure applicable to lower the GHG emissions from their grassland and cropland, these are including:

1. Biomass can be used as a renewable energy source, which could easily replace fossil fuels from conventional cultivation systems (Urbaniec et al., 1384).
2. The soil erosion mitigation strategies.
3. Nitrogen and phosphorus leaching control.
4. Soil moisture preservation measures.
5. Variety of crop rotations by choice of habitats or variations.
6. Microclimate adaptation to mitigate extreme heat and provide insulation.
7. Land utilization alteration including abandonment or expansion of the existing arable land.
8. Improving the efficiency of nitrogen use.
9. Improving the storage of soil carbon (P. Smith & Olesen, 2010).
10. Enhanced sequestration of carbon soil by reduced tillage.
11. Efficiency of fertilizer-N to improved crop utilization.
12. Utilization of chemical or natural nitrification inhibitors.
13. GHG emissions reductions by storing atmospheric Carbon (C) as soil organic matter (Muñoz et al., 2010).
14. Increasing Switching from conventional farming system to the organic farming system.

Eventually, to mitigate outcomes of global warming by considering the adverse effects of CO₂ emissions, accurate measurement of emissions, and urgent action towards mitigating and controlling gasses is inevitable for climate resilience. Further research is necessary to clarify how these greenhouse gases play a role in mitigating the potential impacts of climate change.
