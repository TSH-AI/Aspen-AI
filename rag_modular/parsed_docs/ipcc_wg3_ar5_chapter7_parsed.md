## Executive Summary

The energy systems chapter addresses issues related to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the energy supply sector. The energy supply sector, as defined in this report, comprises all energy extraction, conversion, storage, transmission, and distribution processes that deliver final energy to the end-use sectors (industry, transport, and building, as well as agriculture and forestry). Demand side measures in the energy end-use sectors are discussed in chapters 8 – 11.

The energy supply sector is the largest contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. In 2010, the energy supply sector was responsible for approximately 35% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions. Despite the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, GHG emissions grew more rapidly between 2000 and 2010 than in the previous decade. Annual GHG-emissions growth in the global energy supply sector accelerated from 1.7% per year from 1990 – 2000 to 3.1% per year from 2000 – 2010. The main contributors to this trend were a higher energy demand associated with rapid economic growth and an increase of the share of coal in the global fuel mix.

In the baseline scenarios assessed in AR5, direct CO₂ emissions of the energy supply sector increase from 14.4 GtCO₂/yr in 2010 to 24 – 33 GtCO₂/yr in 2050 (25 – 75th percentile; full range 15 – 42 GtCO₂/yr), with most of the baseline scenarios assessed in AR5 showing a significant increase. The lower end of the full range is dominated by scenarios with a focus on energy intensity improvements that go well beyond the observed improvements over the past 40 years. The availability of fossil fuels alone will not be sufficient to limit CO₂-equivalent (CO₂eq) concentrations to levels such as 450 ppm, 550 ppm, or 650 ppm.

Multiple options exist to reduce energy supply sector GHG emissions. These include energy efficiency improvements and fugitive emission reductions in fuel extraction as well as in energy conversion, transmission, and distribution systems; fossil fuel switching; and low-GHG energy supply technologies such as renewable energy (RE), nuclear power, and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). The stabilization of GHG concentrations at low levels requires a fundamental transformation of the energy supply system, including the long-term substitution of unabated fossil fuel conversion technologies by low-GHG alternatives. Concentrations of CO₂ in the atmosphere can only be stabilized if global (net) CO₂ emissions peak and decline.

There are often co-benefits from the use of RE, such as a reduction of air pollution, local employment opportunities, fewer severe accidents compared to some other forms of energy supply, as well as improved energy access and security. At the same time, however, some RE technologies can have technology- and location-specific adverse side effects, though those can be reduced to a degree through appropriate technology selection, operational adjustments, and siting of facilities.

## Energy Systems

Infrastructure and integration challenges vary by RE technology and the characteristics of the existing background energy system (medium evidence, medium agreement). Operating experience and studies of medium to high penetrations of RE indicate that these issues can be managed with various technical and institutional tools. As RE penetrations increase, such issues are more challenging, must be carefully considered in energy supply planning and operations to ensure reliable energy supply, and may result in higher costs.

Nuclear energy is a mature low-GHG emission source of baseload power, but its share of global electricity generation has been declining (since 1993). Nuclear energy could make an increasing contribution to low-carbon energy supply, but a variety of barriers and risks exist (robust evidence, high agreement). Its specific emissions are below 100 gCO₂eq per kWh on a lifecycle basis and with more than 400 operational nuclear reactors worldwide, nuclear electricity represented 11% of the world’s electricity generation in 2012, down from a high of 17% in 1993. Pricing the externalities of GHG emissions (carbon pricing) could improve the competitiveness of nuclear power plants.

Barriers to and risks associated with an increasing use of nuclear energy include operational risks and the associated safety concerns, uranium mining risks, financial and regulatory risks, unresolved waste management issues, nuclear weapon proliferation concerns, and adverse public opinion (robust evidence, high agreement). New fuel cycles and reactor technologies addressing some of these issues are under development and progress has been made concerning safety and waste disposal (medium evidence, medium agreement).

Mitigation scenarios with low-GHG concentration targets (430 – 530 ppm CO₂eq) require a fundamental transformation of the energy system in the long term. In mitigation scenarios reaching about 450 ppm CO₂eq by 2100, natural gas power generation without CCS typically acts as a bridge technology, with deployment increasing before peaking and falling to below current levels by 2050 and declining further in the second half of the century (robust evidence, high agreement).

Carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies could reduce the lifecycle GHG emissions of fossil fuel power plants (medium evidence, medium agreement). While all components of integrated CCS systems exist and are in use today by the fossil fuel extraction and refining industry, CCS has not yet been applied at scale to a large, commercial fossil fuel power plant. A variety of pilot and demonstrations projects have led to critical advances in the knowledge of CCS systems and related engineering, technical, economic and policy issues. CCS power plants could be seen in the market if they are required for fossil fuel facilities by regulation or if they become competitive with their unabated counterparts, for instance, if the additional investment and operational costs, caused in part by efficiency reductions, are compensated by sufficiently high carbon prices (or direct financial support).

Beyond economic incentives, well-defined regulations concerning short- and long-term responsibilities for storage are essential for a large-scale future deployment of CCS. Barriers to large-scale deployment of CCS technologies include concerns about the operational safety and long-term integrity of CO₂ storage as well as transport risks (limited evidence, medium agreement). There is, however, a growing body of literature on how to ensure the integrity of CO₂ wells, on the potential consequences of CO₂ migration out of the primary injection zone.

### TABLE 7.1: GHG Emissions from Energy Supply

| Energy Source         | GHG Emissions (gCO₂eq/kWh) |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Coal                  | 900                         |
| Natural Gas           | 400                         |
| Nuclear               | 100                         |
| Wind                  | 10                          |
| Solar                 | 20                          |

The success of energy policies depends on capacity building, the removal of financial barriers, the development of a solid legal framework, and the establishment of clear regulations to support the adoption of low-GHG energy technologies due to the resulting fuel- and technology-dependent markup in marginal costs. Technology policies (e.g., feed-in tariffs, quotas, and tendering/bidding) have proven successful in increasing the share of RE technologies (medium evidence, medium agreement).

## 7.8 Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage

Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is a technology that can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel power plants. The process involves capturing CO₂ emissions at their source, transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it underground in geological formations.

### 7.8.1 Overview of CCS Technologies

CCS technologies can be categorized into three main components: capture, transport, and storage. Each component has its own set of challenges and technological requirements.

1. **Capture**: This involves the separation of CO₂ from other gases produced in industrial processes. Various methods include:
- Pre-combustion capture
- Post-combustion capture
- Oxy-fuel combustion

2. **Transport**: Once captured, CO₂ must be transported to storage sites. This is typically done via pipelines, but can also involve shipping.

3. **Storage**: The final step is the injection of CO₂ into geological formations, such as depleted oil and gas fields or deep saline aquifers.

### 7.8.2 Challenges and Risks

Despite its potential, CCS faces several challenges:
- **Technical**: The efficiency of capture technologies and the integrity of storage sites must be ensured.
- **Economic**: High costs associated with CCS implementation can deter investment.
- **Regulatory**: Clear regulations are needed to govern the long-term storage of CO₂ and to address liability issues.

### 7.8.3 Future Directions

Research and development in CCS technologies are ongoing, with a focus on improving efficiency and reducing costs. Innovations in materials and processes could enhance the viability of CCS as a key component in reducing global GHG emissions.

# Chapter 7

The energy infrastructure in developing countries, especially in Least Developed Countries (LDCs), is still undeveloped and not diversified (robust evidence, high agreement). There are often co-benefits associated with the implementation of mitigation energy technologies at centralized and distributed scales, which include local employment creation, income generation for poverty alleviation, as well as building much-needed technical capability and knowledge transfer. There are also risks in that the distributive impacts of higher prices for low-carbon energy might become a burden on low-income households, thereby undermining energy-access programmes, which can, however, be addressed by policies to support the poor.

Chapter 7 considers mitigation options in energy-extraction industries (oil, gas, coal, uranium, etc.), while other extractive industries are addressed in Chapter 10. Together with aspects related to bioenergy usage, provision of biomass is discussed in Chapter 11, which covers land uses including agriculture and forestry. Only energy supply sector-related policies are covered in Chapter 7 while the broader and more-detailed climate policy picture is presented in Chapters 13 – 15.

The derivation of least-cost mitigation strategies must take into account the interdependencies between energy demand and supply. Due to the selected division of labor described above, Chapter 7 does not discuss demand-side measures from a technological point of view. Tradeoffs between demand- and supply-side options, however, are considered by the integrated models (IAM) that delivered the transformation pathways collected in the WGIII AR5 Scenario Database.

## 7.1 Introduction

The energy supply sector is the largest contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2010, approximately 35% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions were attributed to this sector. Despite the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, annual GHG-emissions growth from the global energy supply sector accelerated from 1.7% per year in 1990 – 2000 to 3.1% in 2000 – 2010. Rapid economic growth (with the associated higher demand for power, heat, and transport services) and an increase of the share of coal in the global fuel mix were the main contributors to this trend.

The energy supply sector, as defined in this chapter, comprises all energy extraction, conversion, storage, transmission, and distribution processes with the exception of those that use final energy to provide energy services in the end-use sectors (industry, transport, and building, as well as agriculture and forestry). Concerning energy statistics data as reported in Sections 7.2 and 7.3, power, heat, or fuels that are generated on site for own use exclusively are not accounted for in the assessment of the energy supply sector. Note that many scenarios in the literature do not provide a sectoral split of energy-related emissions.

## Section 7.8: Emission-Reduction Potentials and Related Costs

### 7.8.1 Overview

The potential for emission reductions in the energy supply sector is significant, with various technologies and practices available to achieve these reductions. The costs associated with these technologies vary widely, depending on the specific context and implementation strategies.

### 7.8.2 Technological Options

Several technological options exist for reducing emissions in the energy supply sector, including:

- Renewable energy sources (solar, wind, hydro, etc.)
- Carbon capture and storage (CCS)
- Energy efficiency improvements
- Transitioning to lower-carbon fuels

### 7.8.3 Economic Considerations

The economic implications of implementing emission-reduction technologies must be carefully considered. Factors such as initial investment costs, operational costs, and potential savings from reduced fuel consumption play a crucial role in determining the feasibility of these technologies.

### Figure 7.1
Illustrative energy supply paths shown in order to illustrate the boundaries of the energy supply sector as defined in this report. The self-generation of heat and power in the end-use sectors (i.e., transport, buildings, industry, and Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU)) is discussed in Chapters 8 – 11.

### 7.2 Energy Production, Conversion, Transmission, and Distribution

The energy supply sector converts over 75% of total primary energy assessed as the difference between the energy inputs to (78% of TPES) and outputs from this sector (48.7% of TPES) account for 29.3% of TPES (Table 7.1). The TPES is not only a function of end users’ demand for higher-quality energy carriers, but also the relatively low average global efficiency of energy conversion, transmission, and distribution processes (only 37% efficiency for fossil fuel power and just 83% for fossil fuel district heat generation). However, low efficiencies and large own energy use of the energy sector result in high energy losses.

### Figure 7.2: Contribution of energy sources to global and regional primary energy use increments

Notes: Modern biomass contributes 40% of the total biomass share. Underlying data from IEA (2012a) for this figure have been converted using the direct equivalent method of accounting for primary energy. Legend: OECD-1990 (OECD-1990), Asia (ASIA), Economies in Transition (EIT), Middle East and Africa (MAF), and Latin America (LAM), total primary energy supply (TPES).

----

Between 2000 – 2010, TPES grew by 27% globally (2.4% per annum), while for the regions it was 79% in Asia, 47% in Middle East and Africa (MAF), 32% in Latin America (LAM), 13% in Economies in Transition (EIT), and it was nearly stable for the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 1990 (OECD90) (IEA, 2012a). After 2010, global TPES grew slower (close to 2% per annum over 2010 – 2012) with Asia, MAF, and LAM showing significant growth.

Led by Asia, global coal consumption grew in 2000 – 2010 by over 4% per annum and a slightly slower rate in 2010 – 2012. Coal contributed 44% of the growth in energy use and this growth alone matched the total increase in global TPES for 1990 – 2000. Power generation remains the main global coal renaissance driver (US DOE, 2012). China is the leading coal producer (47% of world 2012 production), followed by the United States, Australia, Indonesia, and India.

## Chapter 7

In 2012, hydroelectricity supplied 16.3% of world electricity. Competitive power markets flexible to gas and coal price spreads are creating stronger links between gas and coal markets driving recent coal use down in the USA, but up in EU.

New post-2000 trends were registered for nuclear’s role in global energy systems. In recent years, the share of nuclear energy in world power generation has declined. Nuclear electricity represented 11% of the world’s electricity generation in 2012, down from a high of 17% in 1993; its contribution to global TPES is declining since 2002. Meeting demand has required mobilization of both conventional and unconventional liquid supplies. Relatively low transportation costs have given rise to a truly global oil market with 55% of crude consumption and 28% of petroleum products being derived from cross-border trade (Table 7.1). The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 2012 provided 43% of the world’s total oil supply keeping its share above its 1980 level; 33% came from the Middle East. The most significant non-OPEC contributors to production growth since 2000 were Russia, Canada, United States, Kazakhstan, Brazil, and China. Growing reliance on oil imports raises concerns of Asia and other non-OECD regions about oil prices and supply security.

### 7.3 New developments in emission trends and drivers

In the global gas balance, the share of unconventional gas production (shale gas, tight gas, coal-bed methane, and biogas) grew to 16% in 2011. The shale gas revolution put the United States on top of the list of major contributors to additional gas supply, followed by Qatar, Iran, China, Norway, and Russia. Although the 2000–2010 natural gas consumption increments are more widely distributed among the regions than for oil and coal, gas increments in Asia and the MAF dominate. The low energy density of gas means that transmission and storage make up a large fraction of the total supply chain costs, thus limiting market development. Escalation of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) markets to 32% of international gas trade in 2012 has, however, created greater flexibility and opened the way to global trade in gas. Growth in United States natural gas production and associated domestic gas prices decline have resulted in the switching of LNG supplies to markets with higher prices in South America, Europe, and Asia. Nevertheless, natural gas supply by pipelines still delivers the largest gas volumes in North America and in Europe.

Renewables contributed 13.5% of global TPES in 2010 (Table 7.1). The share of renewables in global electricity generation approached 21% in 2012, making them the third-largest contributor to global electricity production, just behind coal and gas, with large chances to become the second-largest contributor well before 2020. Greatest growth during 2005–2012 occurred in wind and solar, with generation from wind increasing 5-fold, and from solar photovoltaic, which grew 25-fold. By 2012, wind power accounted for over 2% of world electricity production. Additional energy use from solar and wind energy was driven mostly by two regions, OECD90 and Asia.

### Figure 7.3
Energy supply sector GHG emissions by subsectors. Table shows average annual growth rates of emissions over decades and the shares (related to absolute emissions) of different emission sources. Right-hand graph displays contribution of different drivers (POP = population, GDP = gross domestic product, FEC = final energy consumption, TPES = total primary energy supply) to energy supply sector GHG (GHGs) decadal emissions increments. It is based on (IEA, 2012a). The large graph and table are based on the Historic Emission Database EDGAR / IEA dataset (IEA, 2012g; JRC / PBL, 2013).

### 7.8 Decomposition Analysis

Decomposition analysis (Figure 7.3) shows that population growth contributed 39.7% of additional sector emissions in 2000 – 2010, the strongest emissions growth in the last 30 years, with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita contributing 72.4%. Over the same period, energy intensity decline (final energy consumption (FEC) per unit of GDP) reduced the emissions increment by 45.4%. Since electricity production grew by 1% per year faster than TPES, the ratio of TPES / FEC increased contributing 13.1% of the additional emissions.

Sector carbon intensity relative to TPES was responsible for 20.2% of additional energy supply sector GHG emissions. In non-OECD90 countries, energy-related emissions increased on average from 1.7% per year in 1990 – 2000 to 5.0% in 2000 – 2010 due to TPES growth accompanied by a 0.6% per annum growth in energy carbon intensity, driven largely by coal demand in Asia (IEA, 2012b). As a result, in 2010 non-OECD90 countries’ energy supply sector GHG emissions were 2.3-fold that for OECD90 countries.

### Figure 7.4
Energy supply sector GHG emissions by subsectors and regions: OECD-1990, ASIA countries, Economies in Transition (EIT), Africa and the Middle East (MAF), and Latin America (LAM). Right-hand graph shows contribution of different regions to decadal emissions increments. Source: Historic Emission Database EDGAR / IEA (IEA, 2012g; JRC / PBL, 2013).

By 2010, Asia had become the major emitter with a 41% share. China’s emissions surpassed those of the United States, and India’s surpassed Russia’s (IEA, 2012f). Asia accounted for 79% of additional energy supply sector emissions in 1990–2000 and 83% in 2000–2010, followed well behind by the MAF and LAM regions (Figure 7.4). The rapid increase in energy supply sector GHG emissions in developing Asia was due to the region’s economic growth and increased use of fossil fuels. The per-capita energy supply sector GHG emissions in developing countries are below the global average, but the gap is shrinking, especially for Asia (Figure 7.4). The per-capita energy supply sector CO₂ emissions of Asia (excluding China) in 2010 was only 0.75 tCO₂, against the world average of 2.06 tCO₂, while the 2010 Chinese energy supply sector CO₂ emissions per capita of 2.86 tCO₂ exceeded the 2.83 tCO₂ of OECD-Europe (IEA, 2012f).

Reserves are those quantities able to be recovered under existing economic and operating conditions (BP, 2011); resources are those where economic extraction is potentially feasible (UNECE, 2010a).

For climate change, it is the CO₂ emitted to the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels that matters. When compared to the estimated CO₂ budgets of the emission scenarios presented in Chapter 6 (Table 6.2), the estimate of the total fossil fuel reserves and resources contains sufficient carbon, if released, to yield radiative forcing above that required to limit global mean temperature change to less than 2 °C. The scenario analysis carried out in Section 6.3.4 illustrates in detail that the availability of fossil fuels alone will not be sufficient to limit CO₂eq concentration to levels such as 450 ppm, 550 ppm, or 650 ppm.

Cumulative past production of conventional oil falls between the estimates of the remaining reserves, suggesting that the peak in conventional oil production is imminent or has already been passed (Höök et al., 2009; Owen et al., 2010; Sorrell et al., 2012). Including resources extends conventional oil availability considerably. However, depending on such factors as demand, the depletion and recovery rates achievable from the oil fields (IEA, 2008a; Sorrell et al., 2012), even the higher range in reserves and resources will only postpone the peak by about two decades, after which global conventional oil production is expected to begin to decline, leading to greater reliance on unconventional sources.

### 7.4.2 Renewable energy

For the purpose of AR5, renewable energy (RE) is defined as in the SRREN (IPCC, 2011a) to include bioenergy, direct solar energy, geothermal energy, hydropower, ocean energy, and wind energy. The technical potential for RE is defined in Verbruggen et al. (2011) as “the amount of renewable energy output obtainable by full implementation of demonstrated technologies or practices.” A variety of practical, land use, environmental, and/or economic constraints are sometimes used in estimating the technical potential of RE, but with little uniformity across studies in the treatment of these factors, including costs. Definitions of technical potential therefore vary by study (e.g., Verbruggen et al., 2010), as do the data, assumptions, and methods used to estimate it (e.g., Angelis-Dimakis et al., 2011). There have also been questions regarding the sustainability of some RE sources, as some forms of biomass and geothermal energy may be extracted at a rate that exceeds the natural rate of replenishment. Most, but not all, RE sources impose smaller GHG burdens than do fossil fuels when providing similar energy services.

## 7.4.3 Nuclear energy

The average uranium (U) concentration in the continental Earth’s crust is about 2.8 ppm, while the average concentration in ocean water is 3 to 4 ppb (Bunn et al., 2003). The theoretically available uranium in the Earth’s crust is estimated at 100 teratonnes (Tt) U, of which 25 Tt U occur within 1.6 km of the surface (Lewis, 1972). The amount of uranium dissolved in seawater is estimated at 4.5 Gt (Bunn et al., 2003). Without substantial research and development (R&D) efforts to develop vastly improved and less expensive extraction technologies, these occurrences do not represent practically extractable uranium. Current market and technology conditions limit extraction of conventional uranium resources to concentrations above 100 ppm U.

Considering all RE sources together, the estimates reported by this literature suggest that global and regional technical potentials are unlikely to pose a physical constraint on the combined contribution of RE to the mitigation of climate change (also see GEA, 2012). Additionally, as noted in IPCC (2011b), “Even in regions with relatively low levels of technical potential for any individual renewable energy source, there are typically significant opportunities for increased deployment compared to current levels.” Moreover, as with other energy sources, all else being equal, continued technological advancements can be expected to increase estimates of the technical potential for RE in the future, as they have in the past (Verbruggen et al., 2011).

Nonetheless, the long-term percentage contribution of some individual RE sources to climate change mitigation may be limited by the available technical potential if deep reductions in GHG emissions are sought (e.g., hydropower, bioenergy, and ocean energy), while even RE sources with seemingly higher technical potentials (e.g., solar, wind) will be constrained in certain regions (see Fischedick et al., 2011). Additionally, as RE deployment increases, progressively lower-quality resources are likely to remain for incremental use and energy conversion losses may increase, e.g., if conversion to alternative carriers such as hydrogen is required (Moriarty and Honnery, 2012). Competition for land and other resources among different RE sources may impact aggregate technical potentials, as might concerns about the carbon footprint and sustainability of the resource (e.g., biomass) as well as further information concerning reactor technologies, costs, risks, co-benefits, deployment barriers and policy aspects can be found in Sections 7.5.4, 7.8.2, 7.9, 7.10, and 7.12, respectively.

## 7.5 Mitigation technology options, practices and behavioral aspects

Climate change can only be mitigated and global temperature be stabilized when the total amount of CO₂ emitted is limited and emissions eventually approach zero (Allen et al., 2009; Meinshausen et al., 2009). Options to reduce GHG emissions in the energy supply sector reduce the lifecycle GHG-emissions intensity of a unit of final energy (electricity, heat, fuels) supplied to end users. Section 7.5 therefore addresses options to replace unabated fossil fuel usage with technologies without direct GHG emissions, such as renewable and nuclear energy sources, and options to mitigate GHG emissions from the extraction, transport, and conversion of fossil fuels through increased efficiency, fuel switching, and GHG capture. In assessing the performance of these options, lifecycle emissions have to be considered. Appropriate policies need to be in place to ensure that the adoption of such options leads to a reduction and ultimate phaseout of freely emitting (i.e., unabated) fossil technologies and not only to reduced additional energy consumption, as indicated in Section 7.12.

The main focus of the discussion has been drilling, well completion, and gas product, but gas grids (Ryerson et al., 2013) and liquefaction (Jaramillo et al., 2007) are also important. Options discussed in this section put some emphasis on electricity production, but many of the same options could be used to produce heat or transport fuels or deliver heating and transportation services through electrification of those demands.

There has also been some attention to fugitive emissions of methane from coal mines (Su et al., 2011; Saghafi, 2012) in connection with opportunities to capture and use or treat coal-seam gas (Karacan et al., 2011). Emission rates vary widely based on geological factors such as the age of the coal and previous leakage from the coal seam (Moore, 2012).

Taking into account revised estimates for fugitive methane emissions, recent lifecycle assessments indicate that specific GHG emissions are reduced by one half (on a per-kWh basis) when shifting from the current world-average coal-fired power plant to a modern natural gas combined-cycle (NGCC) power plant, evaluated using the 100-year global warming potentials (GWP) (Burnham et al., 2012), as indicated in Figure 7.6 (Section 7.8). This reduction is the result of the lower carbon content of natural gas (15.3 gC/MJ compared to, e.g., 26.2 gC/MJ for sub-bituminous coal) and the higher efficiency of combined-cycle power plants (IEA, 2011a). A better appreciation of the importance of fugitive emissions in fuel chains since AR4 has resulted in a downward adjustment of the estimated benefit from fuel switching. More modest emissions reductions result when shifting from current average coal plants to the best available coal technology or less-advanced gas power plants. Climate mitigation consistent with the Cancun Agreement requires a reduction of emissions rates below that of NGCC plants by the middle of this century (Figure 7.7, Section 7.8.2 and Figure 7.9, Section 7.11), but natural gas may play a role as a transition fuel in combination with variable renewable sources (Levi, 2013).

### 7.5.1 Fossil fuel extraction, conversion, and fuel switching

Several important trends shape the opportunity to mitigate emissions associated with the extraction, transport, and conversion of fossil fuels:
1. New technologies that make accessible substantial reservoirs of shale gas and unconventional oil.
2. A renewed focus on fugitive methane emissions, especially those associated with gas production.
3. Increased effort required to find and extract oil.
4. Improved technologies for energy efficiency and the capture or prevention of methane emissions in the fuel supply chain.

Carbon dioxide capture technologies are discussed in Section 7.5.5.

## Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Plants

Combined heat and power (CHP) plants are capable of recovering a share of the waste heat that is otherwise released by power plants that generate only electricity. The global average efficiency of fossil-fuelled power plants is 37%, whereas the global average efficiency of CHP units is 58% if both power and the recovered heat are taken into account. State of the art CHP plants are able to approach efficiencies over 85%. The usefulness of decentralized cogeneration units is discussed in literature. Further emissions reductions from fossil fuel systems are possible through CO₂ capture and storage.

Producing oil from unconventional sources and from mature conventional oil fields requires more energy than producing it from virgin conventional fields. Literature indicates that the net energy return on investment has fallen steadily for conventional oil to less than 10 GJ/GJ. For oil sands, the net energy return ratio of the product delivered to the customer is about 3 GJ/GJ invested, with similar values expected for oil shale. As a result, emissions associated with synthetic crude production from oil sands are higher than those from most conventional oil resources. These emissions are related to extra energy requirements, fugitive emissions from venting and flaring, and land use.

Emissions associated with extraction of oil sands and refining to gasoline are estimated to be 35 – 55 gCO₂eq/MJ fuel, compared to emissions of 20 gCO₂eq/MJ for the production and refining of regular petroleum and 70 gCO₂eq/MJ associated with combusting this fuel. Overall, fossil fuel extraction and distribution are currently estimated to contribute 5% – 10% of total fossil-fuel-related GHG emissions. Emissions associated with fuel production and transmission can be reduced through higher energy efficiency and the use of lower-carbon energy sources in mines, fields, and transportation networks.

Pipelines are the most efficient means to transport fluids. Additives can ease the flow of oil and reduce the energy used. New pumps technology, pipeline pigging facilities, chemicals such as pour point depressants, and drag-reducing agents are good examples of technologies that increase pipeline throughput.

Finally, it is worth noting that the decarbonization of heat through heat pumps and transport through an increased use of electric vehicles (EVs) could require major additions to generation capacity and improved transmission and distribution infrastructure.

### 7.5.2 Energy Efficiency in Transmission and Distribution

Electrical losses associated with the high-voltage transmission system are generally less than losses within the lower-voltage distribution system mainly because the total length of transmission lines is far less than that for distribution in most power systems, and that currents and thus losses are lower at high voltages. These losses are due to a combination of cable or line losses and transformer losses and vary with the nature of the power system, particularly its geographical layout.

### 7.5.3 Renewable Energy Technologies

Only a small fraction of the renewable energy (RE) technical potential has been tapped so far.

## Section 7.8: Renewable Energy Technologies

Not all forms of renewable energy (RE) supply have low lifecycle GHG emissions in comparison to fossil fuels. Though RE sources are often discussed together as a group, the specific conversion technologies used are numerous and diverse. A comprehensive survey of the literature is available in IPCC (2011a). Renewable energy sources are capable of supplying electricity, but some sources are also able to supply thermal and mechanical energy, as well as produce fuels that can satisfy multiple energy service needs.

Many RE sources are primarily deployed within larger, centralized energy networks, but some technologies can be — and often are — deployed at the point of use in a decentralized fashion. The use of RE in the transport, buildings, and industrial sectors, as well as in agriculture, forestry, and human settlements, is addressed more fully in subsequent sections.

Fischedick et al. (2011) find that, while there is no obvious single dominant RE technology likely to be deployed at a global level, bioenergy, wind, and solar may experience the largest incremental growth. The mix of RE technologies suited to a specific location, however, will depend on local conditions, with hydropower and geothermal playing a significant role in certain countries.

Because some forms of RE are primarily used to produce electricity (e.g., Armaroli and Balzani, 2011), the ultimate contribution of RE to overall energy supply may be dictated in part by the future electrification of transportation and heating/cooling or by using RE to produce other energy carriers, e.g., hydrogen.

The performance and cost of many RE technologies have advanced substantially in recent decades. For example, improvements in photovoltaic (PV) technologies and manufacturing processes, along with changed market conditions (i.e., manufacturing capacity exceeding demand) and reduced non-hardware costs, have substantially reduced PV costs and prices. Continued increases in the size and therefore energy capture of individual wind turbines have reduced the levelized cost of land-based wind energy and improved the prospects for future reductions in the cost of offshore wind energy. Concentrated solar thermal power (CSP) technologies, some together with thermal storage or as gas/CSP hybrids, have been installed in a number of countries. Research, development, and demonstration of enhanced geothermal systems have continued, enhancing the prospects for future commercial deployments. Performance improvements have also been made in cropping systems, logistics, and multiple conversion technologies for bioenergy.

As discussed in IPCC (2011a), a growing number of RE technologies have achieved a level of technical and economic maturity to enable deployment at significant scale, while others are less mature and not yet widely deployed. Most hydropower technologies, for example, are technically and economically mature. Bioenergy technologies, meanwhile, are diverse and span a wide range; examples of mature technologies include conventional biomass-fuelled power plants and heating systems as well as ethanol production from sugar and starch, while many lignocellulose-based transport fuels are at a pre-commercial stage. The maturity of solar energy ranges from the R&D stage (e.g., fuels produced from solar energy), to relatively more technically mature (e.g., CSP), to technically mature (e.g., solar heating and wafer-based silicon PV); however, even the technologies that are more technically mature have not all reached a state of economic competitiveness. Geothermal power and heat technologies that rely on hydrothermal resources use mature technologies, whereas enhanced geothermal systems continue to undergo R&D with some limited demonstration plants now deployed. Except for certain types of tidal barrages, ocean energy technologies are also at the demonstration phase and require additional R&D. Traditional land-based wind technologies are mature, while the use of wind energy in offshore locations is increasing but is typically more costly than land-based wind.

With regard to traditional biomass, the conversion of wood to charcoal in traditional kilns results in low-conversion efficiencies. A wide range of interventions have tried to overcome this challenge by promoting more efficient kilns, but the adoption rate has been limited in many countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Although not yielding large GHG savings in global terms, increasing the efficiency of charcoal production offers local benefits such as improved charcoal delivery and lower health and environmental impacts.

Because the cost of energy from many (but not all) RE technologies has historically been higher than market energy prices, public R&D programmes have been important, and government policies have played a major role in defining the amount and location of RE deployment. Additionally, because RE relies on natural energy flows, some RE technologies must be located at or near the energy resource, collect energy from diffuse energy flows, and produce energy output that is variable and, though power-output forecasting has improved, to some degree unpredictable.

The implications of these characteristics for infrastructure development and network integration are addressed in the relevant sections.

Renewable energy currently constitutes a relatively small fraction of global energy supply, especially if one excludes traditional biomass. However, RE provided almost 21% of global electricity supply in 2012, and RE deployment has increased significantly since the previous assessment. In 2012, RE power capacity grew rapidly, accounting for just over half of the new electricity generation capacity.

Decentralized RE to meet rural energy needs, particularly in the less-developed countries, has also increased, including various modern and advanced traditional biomass options as well as small hydropower, PV, and wind, thereby expanding and improving energy access (IPCC, 2011a; REN21, 2013).

In aggregate, the growth in cumulative renewable electricity capacity equalled 8% from 2010 to 2011 and from 2011 to 2012 (REN21, 2013). Biofuels accounted for 3.4% of global road transport fuel demand in 2012 (REN21, 2013); though growth was limited from 2010 to 2012, growth since the IPCC’s AR4 has been substantial. By the end of 2012, the use of RE in hot water/heating markets included 293 GWth of modern biomass, 255 GWth of solar, and 66 GWth of geothermal heating (REN21, 2013).

### 7.8 Nuclear energy
Nuclear energy is utilized for electricity generation in 30 countries around the world (IAEA, 2013a). There are 434 operational nuclear reactors with a total installed capacity of 371 GWe as of September 2013 (IAEA, 2013a). Nuclear electricity represented 11% of the world’s electricity generation in 2012, with a total generation of 2346 TWh (IAEA, 2013b). The 2012 share of global nuclear electricity generation is down from a high of 17% in 1993 (IEA, 2012b; BP, 2013).

Cost reductions for PV have been particularly sizable in recent years, resulting in and reflecting strong percentage growth rates (albeit from a small base), with the majority of new installations through 2012 coming from Europe (and to a lesser degree Asia and North America) but with manufacturing shifting to Asia (REN21, 2013; see also Section 7.8). The United States and Brazil accounted for 61% and 26%, respectively, of global bioethanol production in 2012, while China led in the use of solar hot water (REN21, 2013).

Of the reactors worldwide, 354 are light-water reactors (LWR), of which 270 are pressurized water reactors (PWR) and 84 are boiling water reactors (BWR) (IAEA, 2013a). The remaining reactor types consist of 48 heavy-water reactors (PHWR), 15 gas-cooled reactors (GCR), 15 graphite-moderated reactors (RBMK/LWGR), and 2 fast breeder reactors (FBR) (IAEA, 2013a). The choice of reactor technologies has implications for safety, cost, and nuclear fuel cycle issues.

Growing demand for electricity, energy diversification, and climate change mitigation motivate the construction of new nuclear reactors.

## Chapter 7: Energy Systems

The electricity from nuclear power does not contribute to direct GHG emissions. There are 69 reactors, representing 67 GWe of capacity, currently under construction in 14 countries. The bulk of the new builds are in China, Russia, India, Korea (Rep. of), and the United States — with 28, 10, 7, 5, and 3 reactors under construction, respectively. New reactors consist of 57 PWR, 5 PHWR, 4 BWR, 2 FBR, and one high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR).

The necessity for uranium enrichment for LWRs and the presence of plutonium in the spent fuel are the primary proliferation concerns. Commercial reactors currently under construction — such as the Advanced Passive-1000 (AP-1000, USA-Japan), Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR, USA-Japan), European Pressurized Reactor (EPR, France), Water-Water Energetic Reactor-1200 (VVER-1200, Russia), and Advanced Power Reactor-1400 (APR-1400, Rep. of Korea) — are Gen III and Gen III+ reactors that have evolutionary designs with improved active and passive safety features over the previous generation of reactors.

Other more revolutionary small modular reactors (SMR) with additional passive safety features are under development. The size of these reactors is typically less than 300 MWe, much smaller than the 1000 MWe or larger size of current LWRs. The idea of a smaller reactor is not new, but recent SMR designs with low power density, large heat capacity, and heat removal through natural means have the potential for enhanced safety. Additional motivations for the interest in SMRs are economies of manufacturing from modular construction techniques, shorter construction periods, incremental power capacity additions, and potential for improved financing.

Several SMR designs are under consideration. Light-water SMRs are intended to rely on the substantial experience with current LWRs and utilize existing fuel-cycle infrastructure. Gas-cooled SMRs that operate at higher temperatures have the potential for increased electricity generation efficiencies relative to LWRs and industrial applications as a source of high-temperature process heat. A 210 MWe demonstration high-temperature pebble-bed reactor (HTR-PM) is under construction in China.

Ultimately, full recycling options based on either uranium or thorium fuel cycles that are combined with advanced reactor designs — including fast and thermal neutron spectrum reactors — where only fission products are relegated as waste can significantly extend nuclear resources and reduce high-level wastes. The choice of the nuclear fuel cycle has a direct impact on uranium resource utilization, nuclear proliferation, and waste management.

The use of enriched uranium fuels for LWRs in a once-through fuel cycle dominates the current nuclear energy system. In this fuel cycle, only a small portion of the uranium in the fuel is utilized for energy production, while most of the uranium remains unused. The composition of spent or used LWR fuel is approximately 94% uranium, 1% plutonium, and 5% waste products. The uranium and converted plutonium in the spent fuel can be used as new fuel through reprocessing.

There is not a commonly accepted, single worldwide approach to dealing with the long-term storage and permanent disposal of high-level waste. Regional differences in the availability of uranium ore and land resources, technical infrastructure and capability, nuclear fuel cost, and societal factors contribute to the complexity of nuclear waste management.

# Chapter 7

Acceptance of waste disposal have resulted in alternative approaches to waste storage and disposal. Regardless of these differences and the fuel cycle ultimately chosen, some form of long-term storage and permanent disposal, whether surface or geologic (subsurface), is required.

There is no final geologic disposal of high-level waste from commercial nuclear power plants currently in operation, but Finland and Sweden are the furthest along in the development of geologic disposal facilities for the direct disposal of spent fuel (Posiva Oy, 2011, 2012; SKB, 2011). In Finland, construction of the geologic disposal facility is in progress and final disposal of spent fuel is to begin in early 2020 (Posiva Oy, 2012). Other countries, such as France and Japan, have chosen to reprocess spent fuel to use the recovered uranium and plutonium for fresh fuel and to dispose of fission products and other actinides in a geologic repository (OECD and NEA, 2007; Butler, 2010). Yet others, such as Korea (Rep. of), are pursuing a synergistic application of light and heavy water reactors to reduce the total waste by extracting more energy from used fuels (Myung et al., 2006). In the United States, waste-disposal options are currently under review with the termination of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada (CRS, 2012). Indefinite dry cask storage of high-level waste at reactor sites and interim storage facilities are to be pursued until decisions on waste disposal are resolved.

The implementation of climate change mitigation policies increases the competitiveness of nuclear energy technologies relative to other technology options that emit GHG emissions. The choice of nuclear reactor technologies and fuel cycles will affect the potential risks associated with an expanded global response of nuclear energy in addressing climate change.

Nuclear power has been in use for several decades. With low levels of lifecycle GHG emissions, nuclear power contributes to emissions reduction today and potentially in the future. Continued use and expansion of nuclear energy worldwide as a response to climate change mitigation require greater efforts to address the safety, economics, uranium utilization, waste management, and proliferation concerns of nuclear energy use.

Research aimed at improving the performance and cost of CO₂ capture systems for the electric power sector is significant across three broad classes of CO₂ capture technologies: pre-combustion, post-combustion, and oxyfuel capture.

The risks associated with a large-scale deployment of CCS technologies include concerns about the lifecycle toxicity of some capture solvents, the operational safety and long-term integrity of CO₂ storage sites, as well as risks associated with CO₂ transport via dedicated pipelines.

## 7.5.5 Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS)

As of mid-2013, CCS has not yet been applied at scale to a large, commercial fossil-fired power generation facility. However, all of the commercial components of integrated CCS systems exist and are in use today by the hydrocarbon exploration, production, and transport, as well as the petrochemical refining sectors.

A ‘complete end-to-end CCS system’ captures CO₂ from large (e.g., typically larger than 0.1 MtCO₂/year) stationary point sources (e.g., hydrocarbon-fuelled power plants, refineries, cement plants, and steel mills), transports and injects the compressed CO₂ into a suitable deep (typically more than 800 m below the surface) geologic structure, and then applies a suite of measurement, monitoring, and verification (MMV) technologies to ensure the safety, efficacy, and permanence of the captured CO₂’s isolation from the atmosphere. As of mid-2013, five large end-to-end commercial CCS facilities were in operation around the world. Collectively, they have stored more than 30 MtCO₂ over their lifetimes.

All of them capture a high-purity CO₂ stream from industrial (i.e., non-electricity-generating) facilities such as natural gas processing plants. The near-term deployment of CCS is likely to arise in just these kinds of industrial facilities that produce high-purity CO₂ waste streams that would otherwise be vented to the atmosphere and/or in situations where the captured CO₂ can be used in a value-added manner as is the case with CO₂-driven tertiary hydrocarbon recovery.

In the long term, the largest market for CCS systems is most likely found in the electric power sector, where the cost of deploying CCS (measured on a USD/tCO₂ basis) will be much higher and, as a result, will be done solely for the purpose of isolating anthropogenic CO₂ from the atmosphere. However, this is unlikely to occur without sufficiently stringent limits on GHG emissions to make it economic to incur these additional costs, regulatory mandates that would require the use of CCS (for example, on new facilities), or sufficient direct or indirect financial support.

## Section 7.8

The deployment of CCS at a scale of 100s of GtCO₂ over the course of this century would imply that large, regional, deep-geologic basins would have to accommodate multiple large-scale CO₂ injection projects while taking into account other industrial activities in the region that could impact the integrity of CO₂ storage reservoirs. The peer-reviewed literature that has looked at these large CCS deployment scenarios stress the need for good CO₂ storage site selection that would explicitly address the cumulative far-field pressure effects from multiple injection projects in a given basin.

A considerable body of practical engineering and scientific knowledge has been generated from the first five large-scale, complete CCS deployments as well as from numerous smaller-scale CCS field experiments and technology demonstrations. In particular, a key advance has been the field testing of MMV technologies to monitor injected CO₂ in a variety of settings. These real-world MMV deployments are the beginnings of a broader portfolio of MMV technologies that can be matched to site-specific geology and project- and jurisdiction-specific MMV needs. The value of high-quality MMV data is becoming clearer as these data allow for the active management of a geologic CO₂ storage formation and can provide operators and regulators with the ability to detect possible leakage out of the target formation at low levels, which, in turn, can reduce the probability and magnitude of adverse events.

As noted by Bachu, Krevor et al., and IPCC, there are a number of key physical and chemical processes that work in concert to help ensure the efficacy of deep-geologic CO₂ storage over time. The accumulated knowledge from the five commercial CCS facilities mentioned above, from many smaller field experiments and technology demonstrations, and from laboratory-based research suggests a declining long-term risk profile for CO₂ stored in deep-geologic reservoirs once active CO₂ injection into the reservoir has ceased. Torvanger et al. builds upon this accumulated knowledge and concludes, “only in the most unfortunate conditions could such CO₂ escape [from deep-geologic CO₂ storage reservoirs and] compromise [humanity’s ability to not exceed a] maximum 2.5 °C warming.”

Further information concerning transport risks, costs, deployment barriers, and policy aspects can be found in Sections 7.6.4, 7.8.2, 7.10, and 7.12, respectively. The use of CCS in the industrial sector is described in Section 10.4.

The direct CO₂ emissions from biogenic feedstock combustion broadly correspond to the amount of atmospheric CO₂ sequestered through the growth cycle of bioenergy production. A net removal of atmospheric CO₂ therefore would result, once the direct emissions are captured and stored using CCS technologies. As a consequence, a combination of bio-energy and CCS (BECCS) generally will result in net negative emissions. Currently, two small-scale examples of commercial precursors to BECCS are capturing CO₂ emissions from ethanol production facilities for enhanced oil recovery in close-proximity facilities.

BECCS is one of the few technologies that is capable of removing past CO₂ emissions remaining in the atmosphere. As this enhances the ‘when’ (i.e., temporal) flexibility during the design of mitigation scenarios considerably, BECCS plays a prominent role in many of the low-stabilization pathways discussed in Chapter 6 and Section 7.11. Potential risks associated with BECCS technologies are related to those associated with the upstream provision of the used biomass as well as those originating from the capture, transport, and long-term underground storage of CO₂ that would be emitted otherwise.

## 7.6 Infrastructure and systemic perspectives

Reducing GHG emissions from the electric power sector will require infrastructure investments and changes in the operations of power systems — these will both depend on the mitigation technologies employed. The fundamental reliability constraints that underpin this process are the requirements that power supply and electricity demand remain in balance at all times (system balancing), that adequate generation capacity is installed to meet (peak) residual demand (capacity adequacy), and that transmission and distribution network infrastructure is sufficient to deliver generation to end users (transmission and distribution). Studies of high variable RE penetration suggest that integrating significant RE generation technology is technically feasible, though economic and institutional barriers may hinder uptake. Integrating high penetrations of RE resources, particularly those that are intrinsically time variable, alongside operationally inflexible generation is expected to result in higher system-balancing costs. Compared to other mitigation options, variable renewable generation will contribute less to capacity adequacy, and, if remote from loads, will also increase transmission costs. The determination of least-cost portfolios of those options that facilitate the integration of fluctuating power sources is a field of active and ongoing research. Obtaining flexibility from fossil generation has a cost and can affect the overall GHG reduction potential of variable RE.

### 7.6.1 Electrical power systems

#### 7.6.1.1 System balancing — flexible generation and loads

Variable RE resources may increase the need for system balancing beyond that required to meet variations in demand. Existing generating resources can contribute to this additional flexibility. An IEA assessment shows the amount of variable RE electricity that can be accommodated using ‘existing’ balancing resources exceeds 20% of total annual electricity supply in seven regions and is above 40% in two regions and one country. Higher RE penetrations will require additional flexible resources. Surplus renewable supply can be curtailed by switching off unwanted plants or through regulation of the power output, but with corresponding economic consequences. Energy storage might play an increasing role in the field of system balancing. Today, pumped hydro storage is the only widely deployed storage technology. Other storage technologies including compressed air energy storage (CAES) and batteries may be deployed at greater scale within centralized power systems in the future.

## 7.6.1.2 Capacity adequacy

One measure of reliability in a power system is the probability that demand will exceed available generation. The contribution of different generation technologies to ensuring the availability of sufficient generation is called the capacity credit or capacity value (Keane et al., 2011). The capacity credit of nuclear, thermal plants with CCS, geothermal, and large hydro is expected to be higher than 90% (i.e., within 10% of the plant nameplate capacity) as long as fuel supply and cooling water is sufficient and maintenance is scheduled outside critical periods. Variable RE will generally have a lower capacity credit that depends on the correlation between generation availability and periods of high demand. The capacity credit of wind power, for instance, ranges from 5% to 40% of the nameplate capacity (Mason et al., 2010; Holttinen et al., 2011); ranges of capacity credits for other RE resources are summarized in Sims et al. (2011).

The addition of significant plants with low capacity credit can lead to the need for a higher planning-reserve margin (defined as the ratio of the sum of the nameplate capacity of all generation to peak demand) to ensure the same degree of system reliability. If specifically tied to RE generation, energy storage can increase the capacity credit of that source; for example, the capacity credit of CSP with thermal storage is greater than without thermal storage (Madaeni et al., 2011).

## 7.6.1.3 Transmission and distribution

Due to the geographical diversity of RE resources, connecting RE sources to the existing transmission system may require the installation of additional transmission capacity and strengthening the existing system if significantly greater power flows are required across the system (Sims et al., 2011). Increased interconnection and strengthened transmission systems provide power system operators the capability to move surplus generation in one region to meet otherwise unmet demand in another, exploiting the geographical diversity of both loads and generation (Rasmussen et al., 2012). Although there will be a need for additional transmission capacity, its installation often faces institutional challenges, and it can be visually intrusive and unpopular in the affected areas. Infrastructure challenges are particularly acute for RE deployment in developing countries, which is why stand-alone decentralized generation, such as with solar home systems, is often favored.

Transmission considerations applied to CCS plants have to reflect the tradeoff between the cost of electrical transmission and the cost of pipeline transport of CO₂ to final depositories (Svensson et al., 2004; Benson et al., 2005; Herzog et al., 2005; Spiecker et al., 2011). Transmission investments may also be needed for future nuclear plants if these are located at some distance from load centers due to public perceptions of health and safety, access to cooling water, or other factors. Distributed generation (DG), where small generating units (often renewable technologies, cogeneration units, or fuel cells) are connected directly to the electricity distribution system and near loads, may not have the same need for expansion of the transmission system. The net impact of DG on distribution networks depends on the local penetration level, the location of DG relative to loads, and temporal coincidence of DG generation and loads (Cossent et al., 2011). As DG grows, system operators would like to have increased visibility and controllability of DG to ensure overall system reliability. Smart grids might include components to facilitate the integration of various DG technologies, allow for more active control of the distribution network, and improve the market value of DG through aggregation into virtual power plants (Pudjianto et al., 2007; Clastres, 2011; IEA, 2011e; Wissner, 2011; Ardito et al., 2013; Hashmi et al., 2013).

## 7.6.2 Heating and cooling networks

Globally, 15.8 EJ were used in 2010 (2.6% of global TPES) to produce nearly 14.3 EJ of district heat for sale at CHP (44%) and heat-only boilers (56%) (Table 7.1). After a long decline in the 1990s, district heat returned to a growing trajectory in the last decade, rising by about 21% above the year-2000 level (IEA, 2012a). This market is dominated by the Russian Federation with a 42% share in the global heat generation, followed by Ukraine, United States, Germany, Kazakhstan, and Poland. Natural gas dominates in the fuel balance of heat generation (46%), followed by coal (40%), oil (5%), biofuels and waste (5%), geothermal and other renewables (2.4%), and a small contribution from nuclear. Development of intelligent district heating and cooling networks in combination with (seasonal) heat storage allows for more flexibility and diversity (combination of wind and CHP production in Denmark) and facilitates additional opportunities for low-carbon technologies (CHP, waste heat use, heat pumps, and solar heating and cooling) (IEA, 2012a). In addition, excess renewable electricity can be converted into heat to replace what otherwise would have been produced by fossil fuels (Meibom et al., 2007).

Statistically reported average global efficiency of heat generation by heat-only boilers is 83%, while it is possible to improve it to 90–95%.

## 7 Energy Systems

The promotion of district heating and cooling systems should also account for future technology developments that impact the district heating sector (building heat demand reduction, high-efficiency single-housing boilers, heat-pump technology, cogeneration reciprocating engines, or fuel cells, etc.), which may allow switching to more efficient decentralized systems (GEA, 2012). District heating and cooling systems could be more energy and economically efficient when heat or coldness load density is high through the development of tri-generation, the utilization of waste heat by communities or industrial sites, if heat (cooling) and power loads show similar patterns, and if heat-loss control systems are well-designed and managed (see 9.4.1.1).

### 7.6.3 Fuel Supply Systems

As noted in Section 7.5.1, fossil fuel extraction and distribution contributes around 5 – 10 % of total fossil fuel related GHG emissions. It has also been noted that specific emissions from this sector will increase due to increased energy requirements of extraction and processing of oil and gas from mature fields and unconventional sources, and the mining of coal from deeper mines. The fuel supply system supporting this sector does, however, provide opportunities to reduce GHG emissions by enabling the delivery of low-carbon fuels (such as biofuels, biogas, renewable H₂, or renewable methane).

### 7.6.4 CO₂ Transport

Opportunities for delivery of liquid fuels are likely limited to fuels such as biodiesel and ethanol at points in the system that enable either storage or blending before transport to distribution nodes, which is discussed in Section 8.3.3; for gaseous fuels, supply of low-carbon fuels could occur across much of the gas delivery network. There is a growing body of research that describes the magnitude and region-specific nature of future CO₂ transport systems. Specifically, there are a growing number of bottom-up studies that examine spatial relationships between where CO₂ capture units might be located and the very heterogeneous distribution, capacity, and quality of candidate geologic storage reservoirs.

More than 50 countries transport high-pressure natural gas through pipe networks greater than 1,000 km in length (Central Intelligence Agency, 2011). Although individual layout varies, connected to these are the lower-pressure networks that distribute gas for power generation, industry, and domestic use. Because of their ability to carry natural gas substitutes, these networks provide an opportunity to expand production of these gases; depending on the availability of resources, estimates suggest substitutes could replace 17.4 EJ of natural gas used in Europe by 2020 (IPCC, 2011a). Low CO₂-emitting natural gas substitutes can be produced from surplus fluctuating renewable electricity generation, e.g., ‘power to methane’ (Sterner, 2009; Arvizu et al., 2011), from other renewable sources such as biomass and waste, or via coal when combined with CCS; CCS can be added to gas production from biomass to further enhance the CO₂-mitigation potential (Carbo et al., 2011). Provided the substitute natural gas meets the relevant gas quality standard (IEA Bioenergy, 2006, 2009; IPCC, 2011a), facilities might rely on dedicated pipelines linking the CO₂ source to an appropriate sink. The work of Johnson and Ogden (2011) suggests that once there is a critical density of CO₂ capture and storage projects in a region, a more-integrated national pipeline network may evolve.

## 7.7 Climate Change Feedback and Interaction

Climate change will affect heating and cooling energy demands, thereby also influencing energy supply needs. The effect on overall energy demand will vary geographically. Many studies indicate that demand for electricity will increase because of greater need for space cooling, while demand for natural gas and oil will decline because of less need for space heating. Peak electricity demand could also increase, especially as a result of extreme events, requiring a disproportionate increase in energy infrastructure. Although impacts on energy demands outside of heating and cooling are less clear, possible effects include increased energy use for climate-sensitive processes, such as pumping water for irrigated agriculture and municipal uses. As another example, reductions or changes to surface water flows could increase energy demand for desalination.

In addition to impacting energy supply through changes in energy demand, climate change will have various impacts on the potential future role of mitigation technologies in the energy supply sector. Though these impacts are summarized here, further details on potential impacts, as well as a summary of how conventional higher-carbon energy supplies might be affected, are available in the WGII AR5 report.

Though the impact of climate change on the primary resource base for fossil fuels is likely to be small, renewable energy sources can be particularly sensitive to climate change impacts. In general, any impacts are expected to increase with the level of climate change, but the nature and magnitude of these effects are technology-dependent and somewhat uncertain, and they may vary substantially on regional and local levels. The SRREN SPM summarizes the available literature as follows:

> “The future technical potential for bioenergy could be influenced by climate change through impacts on biomass production such as altered soil conditions, precipitation, crop productivity, and other factors. The overall impact of a global mean temperature change of less than 2 °C on the technical potential of bioenergy is expected to be relatively small on a global basis. However, considerable regional differences could be expected and uncertainties are larger and more difficult to assess compared to other renewable energy options due to the large number of feedback mechanisms involved. For solar energy, though climate change is expected to influence the distribution and variability of cloud cover, the impact of these changes on overall technical potential is expected to be small. For hydropower, the overall impacts on the global technical potential is expected to be slightly positive. However, results also indicate the possibility of substantial variations across regions and even within countries. Research to date suggests that climate change is not expected to greatly impact the global technical potential for wind energy development but changes in the regional distribution of the wind energy resource may be expected. Climate change is not anticipated to have significant impacts on the size or geographic distribution of geothermal or ocean energy resources.”

## 7.8 Costs and potentials

Renewable heat and power generation and nuclear energy can bring more significant reductions in GHG emissions. The information provided here has been updated from the data provided in SRREN, taking into account new findings and reviews, where available. The ranges of harmonized lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reported in the literature are 18 – 180 gCO₂eq / kWh for PV (Kim et al., 2012; Hsu et al., 2012), 9 – 63 gCO₂eq / kWh for CSP (Burkhardt et al., 2012).

### 7.8.1 Potential emission reduction from mitigation measures

When assessing the potential of different mitigation opportunities, it is important to evaluate the options from a lifecycle perspective to take into account the emissions in the fuel chain and the manufacturing of the energy conversion technology (Annex II.6.3).

| Technology Type | Lifecycle GHG Emissions (gCO₂eq / kWh) |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| PV             | 18 – 180                               |
| CSP            | 9 – 63                                 |

### 7.8.2 Additional considerations

The largest lifecycle GHG emissions are associated with the combustion of coal. Lifecycle assessments reviewed in SRREN (IPCC, 2011a), showed a range of 675 – 1689 gCO₂eq / kWh electricity. Corresponding ranges for oil and gas were 510 – 1170 gCO₂eq / kWh and 290 – 930 gCO₂eq / kWh. For the AR5, the performance of prospective new fossil fuel power plants was assessed, taking into account a revised assessment of fugitive methane emission from coal mining and natural gas supply (Section 7.5.1).

| Fuel Type      | Lifecycle GHG Emissions (gCO₂eq / kWh) |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Coal           | 675 – 1689                              |
| Oil            | 510 – 1170                              |
| Gas            | 290 – 930                               |

### 7.8.3 Impacts of climate change on energy systems

Climate change may also impact the design and operation of energy sourcing and delivery facilities (e.g., US DOE, 2013b). Offshore infrastructure, including gas and oil wells but also certain RE facilities such as offshore wind power plants, are vulnerable to extreme weather events (Karl et al., 2009; Wiser et al., 2011; World Bank, 2011a; Rose et al., 2012; Arent et al., 2014). Production losses from thermal power plants (whether low- or high-carbon facilities) and efficiency losses from energy-delivery infrastructures increase when temperatures exceed standard design criteria (Schaeffer et al., 2012; Sathaye et al., 2013).

| Impact Type    | Description                              |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Production Loss | Increased losses from thermal power plants |
| Efficiency Loss | Increased losses from energy-delivery infrastructures |

Adaptation strategies include infrastructure relocation and reinforcement, cooling-facility retrofit, and proactive water-resource management (Rübbelke and Vögele, 2011; Arent et al., 2014).

### Figure 7.6
Comparative lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from electricity supplied by commercially available technologies (fossil fuels, renewable, and nuclear power) and projected emissions of future commercial plants of currently pre-commercial technologies (advanced fossil systems with CCS and ocean energy). The figure shows distributions of lifecycle emissions (harmonization of literature values for WGIII AR5 and the full range of published values for SRREN for comparison) and typical contributions to lifecycle emissions by source. Note that percentiles were displayed for RE and traditional coal and gas in the SRREN, but not for coal CCS and gas CCS. In the latter cases, the entire range is therefore shown. For fossil technologies, fugitive emissions of methane from the fuel chain are the largest indirect contribution and hence shown separately. For hydropower, the variation in biogenic methane emissions from project to project are the main cause of the large range. See also Annex II and Annex III.

Sources: SRREN (IPCC, 2011a), Wind (Arvesen and Hertwich, 2012), PV (Kim et al., 2012; Hsu et al., 2012), CSP (Burkhardt et al., 2012), ocean and wave (Walker and Howell, 2011; Kelly et al., 2012), geothermal power (Sathaye et al., 2011), hydropower (Sathaye et al., 2011; Hertwich, 2013), nuclear power (Warner and Heath, 2012), bioenergy (Cherubini et al., 2012).

Notes: Harmonized values have been used where available and the mean values of the typical contributions are shown for the set of those cases where the data base allowed the separation. For world average coal and gas, the uncertainty range represents the uncertainty in the mean; the range of the underlying distribution is much larger. For the fossil fuel technologies, all fugitive methane emissions were calculated based on the range provided by (Burnham et al., 2012), infrastructure and supplies are based on (Singh et al., 2011), and direct emissions are based on (Singh et al., 2011; Corsten et al., 2013). For bioenergy, ranges include global climate impacts of CO₂ emissions from combustion of regenerative biomass (i.e., biogenic CO₂) and the associated changes in surface albedo following ecosystem disturbances, quantified according to the IPCC framework for emission metrics (see the 4th IPCC Assessment Report, (Forster et al., 2007)) and using global warming potentials (GWP) with TH = 100 years as characterization factors (Cherubini et al., 2012; Section 11.13.4). These impacts are site-specific and generally more significant for long rotation species. The category ‘Biogas’ includes cases where manure, dedicated crops (e.g., maize), or a mixture of both are used as feedstocks. In addition to the variability in the substrates, the large range in the results reflects different degrees of CH₄ emissions from leakage and digestate storage, with the latter that can be reduced in closed storage systems (Boulamanti et al., 2013). No contribution analysis was available for this category. For methodological issues, see Annex II.6 and Section 11.13.4, for a discussion of the data sources see Annex II.9.3.

| CSP        | 7 – 89                       |

The climate effect of hydropower is very project-specific. Lifecycle emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production related to the construction and operation of hydropower stations reported in the literature fall in the range of up to 40 gCO₂eq/kWh for the studies reviewed in the SRREN (Kumar et al, 2011) and 3 – 7 gCO₂eq/kWh for studies reviewed in (Dones et al., 2007). Emissions of biogenic CH₄ result from the degradation of organic carbon primarily in hydropower reservoirs (Tremblay et al., 2005; Barros et al., 2011; Demarty and Bastien, 2011), although some reservoirs act as sinks (Chanudet et al., 2011). Few studies appraise net emissions from freshwater reservoirs, i.e., adjusting for pre-existing natural sources and sinks and unrelated anthropogenic sources (Kumar et al, 2011, Section 5.6.3.2). A recent meta-analysis of 80 reservoirs indicates that CH₄ emission factors are log-normally distributed, with the majority of measurements being below 20 gCO₂eq/kWh (Hertwich, 2013), but emissions of approximately 2 kgCO₂eq/kWh coming from a few reservoirs with a large area in relation to electricity production and thus low power intensity (W/m²) (Abril et al., 2005; Kemenes et al., 2007, 2011).

Lifecycle direct global climate impacts of bioenergy in Figure 7.6 come from the peer-reviewed literature from 2010 to 2012 (reviewed in Section 11.13.4) and are based on a range of electric conversion efficiencies of 30% – 50%. The category ‘Biomass-dedicated and crop residues’ includes perennial grasses like switchgrass and miscanthus, short-rotation species like willow and eucalyptus, and agricultural byproducts like wheat straw and corn stover. ‘Biomass-forest wood’ refers to sustainably harvested forest biomass from long-rotation species in various climate regions. The range in ‘Biomass-forest wood’ is representative of various forests and climates, e.g., aspen forest in Wisconsin (US), mixed forest in Pacific Northwest (US), pine forest in Saskatchewan (Canada), and spruce forest in Southeast Norway. Impacts from biogenic CO₂ and albedo are included in the same manner as the other GHGs, i.e., converted to gCO₂eq after characterization of emissions from combustion with case-specific GWPs (Cherubini et al., 2012). In areas affected by seasonal snow cover, the cooling contribution from the temporary change in surface albedo can be larger than the warming associated with seasonal snow cover.

The literature reviewed in this section shows that a range of technologies can provide electricity with less than 5% of the lifecycle GHG emissions of coal power: wind, solar, nuclear, and hydropower in suitable locations. In the future, further reductions of lifecycle emissions on these technologies could be attained through performance improvements (Caduff et al., 2012; Dale and Benson, 2013) and as a result of a cleaner energy supply in the manufacturing of the technologies (Arvesen and Hertwich, 2011).

## 7.8 Cost assessment of mitigation measures

Due to their rapid cost decline, some RE sources have become an economical solution for energy supply in an increasing number of countries. Under favourable conditions, large-scale hydropower, larger geothermal projects (> 30 MWe), and wind onshore power plants are already competitive. The same is true for selected off-grid PV applications. As emphasized by the SRREN, support policies, however, are still necessary in order to promote the deployment of many RE in most regions of the world.

Continuous cost reductions are not always a given, as illustrated by the recent increase in costs of offshore wind (+44%) and technologies in an early stage of their development (marine wave and tidal, binary plant geothermal systems). This does not necessarily imply that technological learning has stopped. As observed for PV and wind onshore, phases characterized by an increase of the price might be followed by a subsequent decline, if, for instance, a shortage of input material is eliminated or a ‘shake out’ due to increasing supplier competition is happening. In contrast, a production overcapacity as currently observed in the PV market might result in system prices that are temporarily below production costs. A critical discussion of the solar photovoltaic grid-parity issue can be found in IEA (2013b).

The LCOE of many low-carbon technologies changed considerably since the release of the AR4. Even compared to the numbers published in the SRREN, the decline of LCOE of some RE technologies have been significant. The LCOE of (crystalline silicon) photovoltaic systems, for instance, fell by 57% since 2009. Compared to PV, a similar, albeit less-extreme trend towards lower LCOE has been observed for onshore wind (–15%), land-fill gas (–16%), municipal solid waste (–15%), and biomass gasification (–26%).

While nuclear power plants, which are capable of delivering base-load electrical energy with low lifecycle emissions, have low operating costs, investments in nuclear power are characterized by very large up-front investment costs, and significant technical, market, and regulatory risks. Potential project and financial risks are illustrated by the significant time and cost over-runs of the two novel European Pressurized Reactors (EPR) in Finland and France. Without support from governments, investments in new nuclear power plants are currently generally not economically attractive within liberalized markets, which have access to relatively cheap coal and/or gas. Carbon pricing could improve the competitiveness of nuclear power plants.

The post Fukushima assessment of the economics and future fate of nuclear power is mixed. According to the IEA, the economic performance and future prospects of nuclear power might be significantly affected. The effect will be quite modest at the global level, albeit based on a pre-Fukushima baseline evolution.

| Crystalline Silicon PV         | XX             | -57        |

## 7 Energy Systems

As there is still no commercial large-scale CCS power plant in operation today, the estimation of their projected costs has to be carried on the basis of design studies and few existing pilot projects. The associated problems are described in (Yeh and Rubin, 2010; Global CCS Institute, 2011; Rubin, 2012). The CCS technologies applied in the power sector will only become competitive with unabated technologies if the additional equipment attached to the power plant and their decreased efficiency as well as the additional cost for CO₂ transport and storage is compensated by sufficiently high carbon prices or direct financial support (Lohwasser and Madlener, 2011; IEA, 2013c). BECCS faces large challenges in financing and currently no such plants have been built and tested at scale (see Section 7.5.5).

The deployment of CCS requires infrastructure for long-term storage of waste products, which includes direct CO₂ transport and storage costs, along with costs associated with long-term measurement, monitoring, and verification. The related cost of transport and storage (excluding capture costs) are unlikely to exceed USD 15 / tCO₂ for the majority of CCS deployment scenarios (Herzog et al., 2005; Herzog, 2011; ZEP, 2011b) and some estimates are below USD 5 / tCO₂ (McCoy and Rubin, 2008; Dahowski et al., 2011). Figure 7.7 relies on an assumed cost of USD 10 / tCO₂.

System integration costs (cf. Section 7.6.1, and not included in Figure 7.7) typically increase with the level of deployment and are dependent on the mitigation technology and the state of the background energy system. From the available evidence, these costs appear to be greater for variable renewable technologies than they are for dispatchable power plants (Hirth, 2013). The costs comprise (1) balancing costs (originating from the required flexibility to maintain a balance between supply and demand), (2) capacity adequacy costs (due to the need to ensure operation even at peak times of the residual load), and (3) transmission and distribution costs.

1. Based on assessments carried out for OECD countries, the provision of additional balancing reserves increases the system costs of wind energy by approximately USD 1 to 7 / MWh for wind energy market shares of up to approximately 30% of annual electricity demand (IEA, 2010e, 2011d; Wiser et al., 2011; Holttinen et al., 2011). Balancing costs for PV are in a similar range (Hoke and Komor, 2012).

2. As described in Section 7.6.1, the contribution of variable renewables like wind, solar, and tidal energy to meeting peak demand is less than the resources’ nameplate capacity. Still, determining the cost of additional conventional capacity needed to ensure that peak demands are met is contentious (Sims et al., 2011). Estimates of this cost for wind power range from USD 0 to 10 / MWh (IEA, 2010e, 2011d; Wiser et al., 2011). Because of the coincidence of solar generation with air-conditioning loads, solar at low-penetration levels can in some regions displace a larger amount of capacity, per unit of energy generated, than other supply options, yielding estimates of infrastructure savings as high as USD 23 / MWh greater than the savings from baseload supply options (Mills et al., 2011).

### 7.8 Economic potentials of mitigation measures

Quantifying the economic potential of major GHG-mitigation options is problematic due to the definition of welfare metrics, broader impacts throughout the energy-economic system, and the background energy system carbon intensity, and energy prices (see Sections 3.4.3 and 3.7.1 for a general discussion). Three major approaches to reveal the economic potentials of mitigation measures are discussed in the literature:

- One approach is to use energy supply cost curves, which summarize energy resource estimates (GEA, 2012) into a production cost curve on an annual or cumulative basis. Uncertainties associated with energy cost curves include the relationship between confirmed reserves and speculative resources, the impact of unconventional sources of fuels, future technological change and energy market structures, discounting, physical conditions (e.g., wind speeds), scenarios (e.g., land-use tradeoffs in energy vs. food production) and the uneven data availability on global energy resources. Illustrative renewable resource cost curves are discussed in Section 10.4 and Figure 10.29 of Fischedick et al., (2011).

- A second and broader approach are marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves. The MAC curves (discussed in Section 3.9.3) discretely rank mitigation measures according to their GHG emission abatement cost (in USD / tCO₂) for a given amount of emission reduction (in million tCO₂). The MAC curves have become a standard policy communication tool in assessing cost-effective emissions reductions (Kesicki and Ekins, 2011). There is wide heterogeneity (discussed in detail in Section 3.9.3) in the method of construction, the use of experts vs. models, and the year/region to which the MAC is applied.

## 7.9 Co-benefits, risks and spillovers

There is an increasing body of work showing that the implementation of energy mitigation options can lead to a range of socio-economic co-benefits for, e.g., employment, energy security, and better access to energy services in rural areas (Shrestha and Pradhan, 2010; IPCC, 2011a; UNEP, 2011).

### Employment
Analysis by Cai et al. (2011) shows that as a result of the increased share of renewable energy in China, the power sector registered 472,000 net job gains in 2010. For the same amount of power generated, solar PV requires as many as 18 and 7 times more jobs than nuclear and wind, respectively. Using conservative assumptions on local content of manufacturing activities, van der Zwaan et al. (2013) show that renewable sources of power generation could account for about 155,000 direct and 115,000 indirect jobs in the Middle East by 2050. Examples of Germany and Spain are also noteworthy where 500 to 600 thousand people could be employed in the renewable energy supply sector in each country by 2030 (Lehr et al., 2012; Ruiz-Romero et al., 2012) while the net effect is less clear. Wei et al. (2010) also found that over 4 million full-time jobs could be created by 2030 from the combined effect of implementing aggressive energy-efficiency measures coupled with meeting a 30% renewable energy target. An additional 500,000 jobs could be generated by increasing the share of nuclear power to 25% and CCS to 10% of overall total generation capacity. In line with these trends, Kenley et al. (2009) show that adding 50,000 megawatts by 2020 of new nuclear generating capacity in the United States would lead to 117,000 new jobs, 250,000 indirect jobs, and an additional 242,000 non-nuclear induced jobs. Relating to CCS, although development in this sector could deliver additional employment (Yuan and Lyon, 2012; Bezdek and Wendling, 2013), safeguarding jobs in the fossil-based industry is expected to be the main employment co-benefit (Frankhauser et al., 2008).

Whilst recognizing the growing contribution of mitigation options for employment, some sobering studies have highlighted that this potentially carries a high cost. In the PV sector in Germany, for example, the cost per job created can be as high as USD 2010 236,000 (€175,000 in 2008) (Frondel et al., 2010), underlining that continued employment and welfare gains will remain dependent on the level and availability of support and financing mechanisms (Alvarez et al., 2010; Furchtgott-Roth, 2012; Böhringer et al., 2013). Furthermore, given the higher cost of electricity generation from RE and CCS-based fossil fuels, at least in the short-term, jobs in energy-intensive economic sectors are expected to be affected (Delina and Diesendorf, 2013). The structure of the economy and wage levels will nonetheless influence the extent of industry restructuring and its impact on labour redeployment.

### Energy security
As discussed in Section 6.6.2.2, energy security can generally be understood as “low vulnerability of vital energy systems”.

## Chapter 7

Energy security concerns can be grouped as (1) the sufficiency of resources to meet national energy demand at competitive and stable prices, and (2) the resilience of the energy supply. Important co-benefits of some mitigation options include the sufficiency of national energy demand by decreasing imports and energy intensity while increasing the domestic resource buffer and the diversity of energy supply.

Countries with a high share of energy imports in total imports are relatively more vulnerable to price fluctuations and have historically focused on curtailing energy imports. However, more recently, there has been a focus on building the resilience of energy supply. For energy importers, climate policies can increase the sufficiency of national energy demand by decreasing imports and energy intensity while at the same time increasing the domestic resource buffer and the diversity of energy supply.

Energy-exporting countries are similarly interested in stable and competitive global prices, but they have the opposite interest of maintaining or increasing energy export revenues. There is uncertainty over how climate policies would impact energy export revenues and volumes. One of the biggest energy security issues facing developing countries is the necessity to dramatically expand energy systems to support economic growth and development, which makes energy security in low- and middle-income countries closely related to the energy-access challenge.

### 7.9.2 Environmental and health effects

Energy supply options differ with regard to their overall environmental and health impacts, not only their GHG emissions (Table 7.3). Renewable energies are often seen as environmentally benign by nature; however, no technology, particularly in large scale applications, comes without environmental impacts. To evaluate the relative burden of energy systems within the environment, full energy supply chains need to be considered on a lifecycle basis, including all system components, and across all impact categories.

To avoid creating new environmental and health problems, assessments of mitigation technologies need to address a wide range of issues, such as land and water use, as well as air, water, and soil pollution, which are often location-specific.

| Table 7.3 | Environmental and Health Impacts of Energy Supply Options | | |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---|---|
| Energy Source | GHG Emissions | Other Environmental Impacts | Health Impacts |
| Solar       | Low           | Land use, water use         | Minimal        |
| Wind        | Low           | Land use, noise             | Minimal        |
| Biomass     | Moderate      | Land use, deforestation     | Moderate       |
| Coal        | High          | Air pollution, water use    | High           |
| Natural Gas | Moderate      | Air pollution, water use    | Moderate       |
| Nuclear     | Low           | Radioactive waste           | Low            |

### Box 7.1 | Energy systems of LDCs: Opportunities & challenges for low-carbon development

One of the critical indicators of progress towards achieving development goals in the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) is the level of access to modern energy services. It is estimated that 79% of the LDC population lacked access to electricity in 2009, compared to a 28% average in the developing countries. About 71% of people in LDCs relied exclusively on biomass burning for cooking in 2009. The dominance of subsistence agriculture in LDCs as the mainstay of livelihoods, combined with a high degree of population dispersal and widespread income poverty, have shaped the nature of energy systems in this category of countries. The LDCs from sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia, with limited access to fossil-based electricity (and heat), would need to explore a variety of appropriate sustainable technologies to fuel their development goals. In addition to deploying fossil-based and renewable technologies, improved biomass cooking from biogas and sustainably produced wood for charcoal will remain essential in LDCs.

Bioenergy production from unsustainable biomass harvesting, for direct combustion and charcoal production is commonly practiced. The net GHG emissions from these practices is significant, and rapid urbanization trends are likely to intensify harvesting for wood, contributing further to rises in GHG emissions, along with other localized environmental impacts. However, important initiatives from multilateral organizations and from the private sector with innovative business models are improving agricultural productivity for food and creating bioenergy development opportunities. One example produces liquid biofuels for stove cooking while creating, near cities, agroforestry zones with rows of fast-growing leguminous trees and shrubs and alleys planted with annual crop rotations, surrounded by a forestry shelterbelt zone that contains indigenous trees and oilseed trees.

The mixture of crops and trees produces food with higher nutritive values, enables clean biofuels production for stove cooking, develops businesses, and simultaneously avoids GHG emissions from deforestation to produce charcoal for cooking. A dearth of documented information and a lack of integration of outcomes of the many successful and often difficult to generalize tradeoffs among the different types of impacts, affecting different species, and at different times, become important in carrying out the assessments. Also, the analysis has to go beyond marginal changes in the existing system to address alternative futures. Environmental and health implications of different low-carbon technologies as they are understood today are briefly discussed below.

The exposure to ambient air pollution of 80% of the world’s population is estimated to exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation of 10 μg/m³ for PM2.5. Many of these pollutants can be significantly reduced through various types of pollution control equipment, but even with this equipment in place, some amount of pollution remains. In addition, surface mining of coal and tar sand causes substantial land use and mining waste, both threatening biodiversity.

Volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides cause the formation of photochemical oxidants (summer smog), which impact human health and ecosystems. Reducing fossil fuel combustion, especially coal combustion, can reduce many forms of pollution and may thus yield co-benefits for health and ecosystems.

Coal is an important source of mercury and other toxic metals, harming ecosystems. Most renewable power projects offer a reduction of emissions contributing to particulate matter exposure even compared to modern fossil fuel-fired power plants with state-of-the-art pollution control equipment.

### 7.8 Technical Risks

Within the context of sustainable development, a comprehensive assessment of energy supply and mitigation options needs to take into account technical risks, especially those related to accidents risks. In the event of accidents, fatality and injury may occur among workers and residents. Evacuation and resettlements of residents may also take place. This section, therefore, updates the risk assessment presented in Chapter 9 of the SRREN (IPCC, 2011a): “Accidental events can be triggered by natural hazards (e. g., Steinberg et al., 2008; Kaiser et al., 2009; Cozzani et al., 2010), technological failures (e. g., Hirschberg et al., 2004; Burgherr et al., 2008), purposefully malicious action (e. g., Giroux, 2008), and human errors (e. g., Meshakti, 2007; Ale et al., 2008)”, (IPCC, 2011a, p. 745). An analysis of the fatalities caused by accidents is addressed in Section 7.9.3.

## Chapter 7

Large accidents (≥ 5 fatalities or ≥ 10 injured or ≥ 200 evacuated) recorded in the Energy-Related Severe Accident Database (ENSAD) (Burgherr et al., 2011), as presented in SRREN, allows for a comparison of the potential impacts. The analysis in SRREN included accidents in the fuel chain, such as coal mining and oil shipping, 1970 – 2008. SRREN indicates high fatality rates (> 20 fatalities per PWh) associated with coal, oil, and hydropower in non-OECD countries and low fatalities (< 2 fatalities per PWh) associated with renewable and nuclear power in OECD countries (Figure 9.12 in Sathaye et al., 2011). Coal and oil power in OECD countries and gas power everywhere were associated with impacts on the order of 10 fatalities per PWh.

Coal mining accidents in China were identified to have contributed to 25,000 of the historical total of 33,000 fatalities in severe accidents from 1970 – 2008 (Epstein et al., 2010; Burgherr et al., 2012). New analysis indicates that the accident rate in Chinese coal mining has been reduced substantially, from 5670 deaths in 2001 to 1400 in 2010, or from 5.1 to 0.76 fatalities per Mt coal produced (Chen et al., 2012). The majority of these fatalities is apparently associated with smaller accidents not covered in the ENSAD database. In China, accident rates in smaller coal mines are higher than those in larger mines (Chan and Griffiths, 2010), and in the United States, less profitable mines have higher rates than more profitable ones (Asfaw et al., 2013). A wide range of research into underlying causes of accidents and measures to prevent future accidents is currently under way.

For oil and gas, fatalities related to severe accidents at the transport and distribution stage are a major component of the accident-related external costs. Over 22,000 fatalities in severe accidents for the oil chain were reported, 4000 for LPG, and 2800 for the natural gas chain (Burgherr et al., 2011, 2012). Shipping and road transport of fuels are associated with the highest number of fatalities, and accident rates in non-OECD countries are higher than those in OECD countries (Eckle and Burgherr, 2013).

For hydropower, a single event, the 1975 Banqiao/Shimantan dam failure in China, accounted for 26,000 immediate fatalities. Remaining fatalities from large hydropower accidents amount to nearly 4000, but only 14 were recorded in OECD countries (Moomaw et al., 2011a; Sathaye et al., 2011). The fatality rates of non-hydro RE technologies are lower than those of fossil chains and are comparable to hydro and nuclear power in developed countries. Their decentralized nature limits their capacity to have catastrophic impacts.

Severe nuclear accidents have occurred at Three-Mile Island in 1979, Chernobyl in 1986, and Fukushima in 2011. For Three-Mile Island, no fatalities or injuries were reported. For Chernobyl, 31 immediate fatalities occurred and 370 persons were injured (Moomaw et al., 2011a). As indicated by the SRREN, accidents can result in the contamination of large land and water areas with radionuclides or hydrocarbons. The accidental releases of crude oil and its refined products into the maritime environment have been substantially reduced since the 1970s through technical measures, international conventions, national legislations, and increased financial liabilities (see e.g. Kontovas et al., 2010; IPCC, 2011a; Sathaye et al., 2011). Still, oil spills are common and can affect both marine and freshwater resources (Jernelöv, 2010).

### TABLE 7.1: Fatalities from Energy-Related Severe Accidents

| Energy Source | Fatalities (per PWh) | Region          |

| Coal          | > 20                  | Non-OECD         |

| Nuclear       | < 2                   | OECD             |

The global electricity production in 2008 was 17 PWh.

## 7 Energy Systems

Among CCS technologies, early misgivings include the ecological impacts associated with different storage media, the potential for accidental release and related storage effectiveness of stored CO₂, and the perception that CCS technologies do not prevent all of the non-GHG social and environmental impacts of fossil energy sources. Leakage of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing during shale gas and geothermal operations can potentially contaminate local water flows and reservoirs. Further research is needed to investigate a range of yet poorly understood risks and risk factors related to CCS storage. Risks of CO₂ transport are discussed in Section 7.6.4.

### 7.9.4 Public perception

Though impacts, and related public concerns, cannot be entirely eliminated, assessing, minimizing and mitigating impacts and concerns are elements of many jurisdictions’ planning, siting, and permitting processes. Technical mitigation options show promise, as do procedural techniques, such as ensuring the availability of accurate and unbiased information about the technology, its impacts and benefits; aligning the expectations and interests of different stakeholders; adjusting to the local societal context; adopting benefit-sharing mechanisms; obtaining explicit support at local and national levels prior to development; building collaborative networks; and developing mechanisms for articulating conflict and engaging in negotiation.

For bioenergy, concerns focus on direct and indirect land use and related GHG emissions, deforestation, and possible competition with food supplies. For hydropower, concerns include the possibility of the displacement of human populations, negative environmental impacts, and altered recreational opportunities. For wind energy, concerns primarily relate to visibility and landscape impacts as well as potential nuisance effects, such as noise. For solar energy, land area requirements can be a concern for large, utility-scale plants. For ocean energy, sea area requirements are a concern. Concerns for geothermal energy include the possibility of induced local seismicity and impacts on natural — especially recreational — areas. For nuclear energy, anxieties often focus on health and safety (accidents, disposal of wastes, decommissioning) and proliferation (terrorism, civil unrest). Further, perceptions are dependent on how the debate around nuclear is framed relative to other sources of energy.

From a global perspective, the large number of different technologies that are available to mitigate climate change facilitates the achievement of prescribed climate protection goals. Given that many different combinations of the mitigation technologies are often feasible, least-cost portfolios can be determined that select those options that interact in the best possible way. On a local scale and/or concerning specific technologies, however, technological barriers might constrain their mitigation potential. These limits are discussed in Sections 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, and 7.9.

### 7.10.2 Financial and investment barriers and opportunities

The total global investment in the energy supply sector in 2010 is estimated to be USD 1,076 to 1,350 billion per year, of which 43 – 48 % is invested in the power sector and 37 – 50 % is invested in fossil extraction. In the power sector, 49 – 55 % of the investments is used for power generation and 45 – 51 % is used for transmission and distribution.

Investment in LDCs may be a particular challenge given their less-developed capital markets. Multilateral development banks and institutions for bilateral developmental cooperation will have an important role towards increasing levels of confidence for private investors.

The total investment in renewables excluding hydropower in 2012 was USD 244 billion, which was six times the level in 2004. Out of this total, USD 140 billion was for solar and USD 80 billion for wind power. The total was down 12 % from a record USD 279 billion in 2011 in developing countries for designing and implementing appropriate policies and regulations, including those for efficient and transparent procurement for infrastructure investment, is also important.

Total investment in developed countries fell 29 % in 2012 to USD 132 billion, while investment in developing countries rose 19 % to USD 112 billion. The investment in renewables is smaller than gross investment on fossil-fuel plants (including replacement plant) at USD 262 billion, but much larger than net investment in fossil-fuel technologies, at USD 148 billion. The amount of installed capacity of renewables excluding hydropower was 85 GW, up from 2011's 80 GW.

Additional investments required in the energy supply sector by 2050 are estimated to be USD 190 billion to USD 900 billion/year to limit the temperature increase below 2 °C (about 0.30 % to 1.4 % of world GDP in 2010). The additional investment costs from both supply and demand sides are estimated to be about USD 800 billion/year. With a greater anticipated increase in energy demands, developing countries are expected to require more investments than the developed countries.

Investment needs in the energy supply sector increase under low-GHG scenarios. However, this should be set in the context of the total value of the world’s financial stock, which (including global stock market capitalization) stood at more than USD 210 trillion at the end of 2010. Moreover, the investment needs described above would be offset, to a degree, by the lower operating costs of many low-GHG energy supply sources, as well as those due to energy-efficiency improvements in the end-use sectors.

Though only a fraction of the available private-sector capital stock would be needed to cover the costs of low-GHG energy supply even in aggressive GHG-reduction scenarios, private capital will not be mobilized automatically for such purposes. For this reason, various measures — such as climate investment funds, carbon pricing, feed-in tariffs, RE quotas and RE-tendering/bidding schemes, carbon offset markets, removal of fossil fuel subsidies and private/public initiatives aimed at lowering barriers for investors — are currently being implemented.

### 7.10.3 Cultural, institutional, and legal barriers and opportunities

Managing the transition from fossil fuels to energy systems with a large penetration of low-carbon technologies and improved energy efficiency will pose a series of challenges and opportunities, particularly in the case of poor countries. Depending on the regions and the development, barriers and opportunities may differ dramatically.

Taking the example in the United States, significant social and cultural barriers facing renewable power systems as policymakers continue to frame electricity generation as a mere technical challenge. In the absence of a wider public discourse around energy systems and challenging entrenched values about perceived entitlements to cheap and abundant forms of electricity, RE and energy-efficiency programmes will continue to face public acceptability problems.

Indeed, attitudes towards RE in addition to rationality are driven by emotions and psychological issues. To be successful, RE deployment, as well as information and awareness efforts and strategies need to take this explicitly into account. Legal regulations and procedures are also impacting the deployment of nuclear energy, CCS, shale gas, and renewable energy. However, the fundamental reasons (environment, health, and safety) may differ according to the different types of energy.

## 7.10.4 Human capital capacity building

Lack of human capital is widely recognized as one of the barriers to development, acquisition, deployment, and diffusion of technologies required for meeting energy-related CO₂ emissions reduction targets (IRENA, 2012d). Human capacity is critical in providing a sustainable enabling environment for technology transfer in both the host and recipient countries (Barker et al., 2007; Halsnæs et al., 2007). Human workforce development has thus been identified as an important near-term priority (IEA, 2010c).

There is increasing concern in the energy supply sector in many countries that the current educational system is not producing sufficient qualified workers to fill current and future jobs, which increasingly require science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills. This is true not only in the booming oil and gas and traditional power industries, but also in the rapidly expanding RE supply sector (NAS, 2013b). Skilled workforce in the areas of RE and decentralized energy systems, which form an important part of ‘green jobs’ (Strietska-Ilina et al., 2011), requires different skill sets for different technologies and local context, and hence requires specific training (Moomaw et al., 2011b). Developing the skills to install, operate, and maintain the RE equipment is exceedingly important for a successful RE project, particularly in developing countries (UNEP, 2011), where shortages of teachers and trainers in subjects related to the fast-growing RE supply sector have been reported (Strietska-Ilina et al., 2011) (ILO and EU, 2011). Well-qualified workers will also be required on other low-carbon energy technologies, particularly nuclear and CCS — should there be large-scale implementation (Creutzig and Kammen, 2011; NAS, 2013b).

Apart from technology-oriented skills, capacity for decision support and policymaking in the design and enactment stages is also essential, particularly on assessing and choosing technology and policy options, and designing holistic policies that effectively integrate renewable energy with other low-carbon options, other policy goals, and across different but interconnected sectors (Mitchell et al., 2011; Jagger et al., 2013).

To avoid future skill shortages, countries will need to formulate short- and long-term capacity development strategies based on well-informed policy decisions, and adequate information on labour market and skill needs in the context of low-carbon transition and green jobs (Strietska-Ilina et al., 2011; Jagger et al., 2013). But producing a skilled workforce with the right skills at the right time requires additional or alternatives to conventional approaches. These include, but are not limited to, increased industry-education-government partnership, particularly with industry organizations, in job demand forecasting, designing education and training curricula, augmenting available skills with specific skills, and adding energy supply sector experience in education and training (Strietska-Ilina et al., 2011; NAS, 2013b).

## 7.10.5 Inertia in energy systems physical capital stock turnover

The long life of capital stock in energy supply systems (discussed in detail in Section 5.6.3) gives the possibility of path-dependant carbon lock-in (Unruh, 2002). The largest contribution to GHG emissions from existing high-carbon energy capital stock is in the global electricity sector, which is also characterized by long-lived facilities — with historical plant lifetimes for coal, natural gas, and oil plant of 38.6, 35.8, and 33.8 years, respectively (Davis et al., 2010). Of the 1549 GW investments (from 2000 – 2010) in the global electricity sector (EIA, 2011), 516 GW (33.3%) were coal and 482 GW (31.1%) were natural gas. Only 34 GW (2.2%) were nuclear investments, with combined renewable source power plants at 317 GW (20.5%). The investment share for RE power plants accelerated toward the end of the decade. The transport, industrial, commercial, and residential sectors generally have smaller technology sizes, shorter lifetimes, and limited plant level data for directly emitting GHG facilities; however, in combination...

## 7.11 Sectoral implication of transformation pathways and development sustainable

This section reviews long-term integrated scenarios and transformation pathways with regard to their implication for the global energy system. Focus is given to energy-related CO₂ emissions and the required changes to the energy system to achieve emissions reductions compatible with a range of long-term climate targets. Aggregated energy-related emissions, as primarily discussed in this section, comprise the full energy system, including energy sourcing, conversion, transmission, as well as the supply of energy carries to markets.

### TABLE 7.1 Energy-related greenhouse gas emissions

| Year | Direct CO₂ Emissions (GtCO₂/yr) | Range (GtCO₂/yr) |
|------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| 2010 | 14.4                             |                  |
| 2050 | 24 – 33                         | 25 – 42          |

In the baseline scenarios assessed in AR5, direct CO₂ emissions of the energy supply sector increase from 14.4 GtCO₂/yr in 2010 to 24 – 33 GtCO₂/yr in 2050 (25 – 75th percentile; full range 15 – 42 GtCO₂/yr), with most of the baseline scenarios assessed in AR5 showing a significant increase. The lower end of the full range is dominated by scenarios with a focus on energy intensity improvements that go well beyond the observed improvements over the past 40 years.

In absence of climate change mitigation policies, energy-related CO₂ emissions (i.e., those taking into account the emissions of the energy supply sector) are projected to increase significantly. Note that the other Sections in Chapter 7 are focusing on the energy supply sector, which comprises only energy extraction, conversion, transmission, and distribution. As noted in Section 7.3, CO₂ emissions from the energy supply sector are the most important source of climate forcing. Climate forcing associated with emissions from non-CO₂ greenhouse gases (e.g., CH₄ and N₂O) of the energy supply sector is smaller than for CO₂. For the most part, non-CO₂ greenhouse gases are emitted by other non-energy sectors, though CH₄ is released in primary energy sourcing and supply as a by-product of oil, gas, and coal production as well as in the transmission and distribution of methane to markets. While its share in total GHG emissions is relatively small, the energy supply sector is, however, a major source of sulphur and other aerosol emissions.

High energy demand scenarios show higher levels of oil supply. In high energy demand scenarios, alternative liquid and hydrogen technologies are scaled up more rapidly. High energy demand scenarios show a more rapid up-scaling of CCS technologies but a more rapid phase-out of unabated fossil fuel conversion technologies.

**Figure 7.11** | Influence of energy demand on the deployment of energy supply technologies for stringent mitigation scenarios (430 – 530 ppm CO₂eq) in 2050. Blue bars for ‘low energy demand’ show the deployment range of scenarios with limited growth of final energy of < 20 % in 2050 compared to 2010. Red bars show the deployment range of technologies in case of ‘high energy demand’ (> 20 % growth in 2050 compared to 2010). For each technology, the median, interquartile, and full-deployment range is displayed.

Notes: Scenarios assuming technology restrictions and scenarios with final energy in the base-year outside ± 5 % of 2010 inventories are excluded. Ranges include results from many different integrated models. Multiple scenario results from the same model were averaged to avoid sampling biases. For further details see Chapter 6.

Enhanced efficiency or behavioral changes as well as fuel switching (e.g., from coal to gas) and the introduction of low-carbon supply options such as renewables, nuclear, CCS, in combination with fossil or biomass energy conversion processes, and finally, improvements in the efficiency of fossil fuel use. These are discussed in Section 7.5 as well as in Chapters 8 – 10.

The three scenarios achieve their concentration goals using different portfolios. These differences reflect the wide range in assumptions about technology availability and the policy environment. While the pace of the transformation differs across the scenarios (and depends also on the carbon-intensity and energy-demand development in the baseline), all three illustrative scenarios show the importance of measures to reduce energy demand over the short term. For instance, by 2050 fossil energy use is 230 – 670 EJ lower than in non-climate-policy baseline scenarios.

The numbers refer to the replacement of freely emitting (unabated) fossil fuels without CCS. The contribution of fossil fuels with CCS is increasing in the mitigation scenarios.

### Energy Systems

2030, between 40 – 90 % of the emissions reductions are achieved through energy-demand savings, thus reducing the need for fossil fuels. The long-term contribution of energy-demand savings differs, however, significantly across the three scenarios. For instance, in MESSAGE about 1200 EJ of fossil fuels are replaced through efficiency and demand-side improvements by 2100, compared to about 400 EJ in the GCAM scenario. Achieving concentrations at low levels (430 – 530 ppm CO₂eq) requires significant up-scaling of low-carbon energy supply options. The up-scaling of low-carbon options depends greatly on the development of energy demand, which determines the overall ‘size’ of the system. Hence, scenarios with greater emphasis on efficiency and other measures to limit energy demand generally show less pervasive and rapid up-scaling of supply-side options.

Figure 7.11 compares stringent mitigation scenarios with low and comparatively high global energy demands by 2050. The higher energy-demand scenarios are generally accompanied by higher deployment rates for low-carbon options and more rapid phaseout of freely emitting fossil fuels without CCS. Moreover, and as also shown by Figure 7.11, high energy demand leads to a further ‘lock-in’ into fossil-intensive oil-supply infrastructures, which puts additional pressure on the supply system of other sectors that need to decarbonize more rapidly to compensate for the increased emissions from oil production.

**Figure 7.12** | Comparison of global technical potentials of renewable energy sources (Moomaw et al., 2011b) and deployment of renewable energy technologies in integrated model scenarios in 2050 (WGIII AR5 Scenario Database, see Annex II.10). Solar energy and biomass are displayed as primary energy as they can serve multiple uses. Note that the figure is presented in logarithmic scale due to the wide range of assessed data. Integrated model mitigation scenarios are presented for different ranges of CO₂eq concentration levels.

The reported technical potentials refer to the total worldwide annual RE supply. Any potential that is already in use is not deducted. Renewable energy power sources could also supply heating applications, whereas solar and biomass resources are represented in terms of primary energy because they could be used for multiple (e.g., power, heat, and transport) services. The ranges were derived by using various methodologies and the given values refer to different years in the future. As a result, the displayed ranges cannot be strictly compared across different technologies. Additional information concerning data sources and additional notes that should be taken into account in interpreting the figure, see Moomaw et al. (2011b). Contribution of ocean energy in the integrated model scenarios is less than 0.1 EJ and thus outside the logarithmic scale of the figure. Note that not all scenarios report deployment for all RE sources. The number of assessed scenarios differs thus across RE sources and scenario categories. The abbreviation ‘n.a.’ indicates lack of data for a specific concentration category and RE. Scenarios assuming technology restrictions are excluded.

## 7.8 Role of the electricity sector in climate change mitigation

Electrification of the energy system has been a major driver of the historical energy transformation from an originally biomass-dominated energy system in the 19th century to a modern system with high reliance on coal and gas (two of the major sources of electricity generation today). Many mitigation scenario studies (Edmonds et al., 2006; as well as the AR5 database; cf. Sections 6.3.4 and 6.8) have three generic components:
1. decarbonize power generation;
2. substitute electricity for direct use of fossil fuels in buildings and industry (see Sections 9.3 and 10.4), and in part for transportation fuels (Chapter 8);
3. reduce aggregate energy demands through technology and other substitutions.

Most scenarios in the WGIII AR5 Scenario Database report a continuation of the global electrification trend in the future (Figure 7.13). In the baseline scenarios (assuming no new climate policies) most of the demand for electricity continues to be in the residential, commercial, and industry sectors (see Chapters 9 and 10), while transport sectors rely predominantly on liquid fuels (Section 8.9). Biofuels and electricity both have the potential to provide transport services without fossil fuel emissions. The relative contribution of each depends at least in part on the character of technologies that evolve to provide transport services with each fuel.

Electricity production is the largest single sector emitting fossil fuel CO₂ at present and in baseline scenarios of the future. A variety of mitigation options exist in the electricity sector, including renewables (wind, solar energy, biomass, hydro, geothermal), nuclear, and the possibility of fossil or biomass with CCS. The electricity sector plays a major role in mitigation scenarios with deep cuts of GHG emissions.

### TABLE 7.1: Summary of electricity sector emissions and mitigation options

| Source of Emissions | Current Emissions (GtCO₂) | Mitigation Options                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Coal                | 15                        | Transition to renewables, CCS         |
| Natural Gas         | 7                         | Efficiency improvements, renewables   |
| Oil                 | 3                         | Electrification of transport           |
| Biomass             | 2                         | Sustainable biomass practices          |
| Nuclear             | 0.5                       | Expansion of nuclear capacity          |

### 7.8.1 Decarbonization Pathways

Decarbonization pathways vary significantly across different regions and models. The transition to a low-carbon electricity sector involves a combination of technological advancements, policy frameworks, and market mechanisms. Key strategies include:

- **Investment in Renewable Energy**: Increasing the share of renewables in the energy mix is crucial for reducing emissions.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Implementing energy efficiency measures across all sectors can significantly lower demand and emissions.
- **Carbon Pricing**: Establishing a carbon price can incentivize reductions in emissions and promote cleaner technologies.

### 7.8.2 Challenges to Electrification

Despite the potential benefits of electrification, several challenges must be addressed:

- **Infrastructure Development**: Upgrading and expanding the electricity grid to accommodate renewable energy sources is essential.
- **Public Acceptance**: Gaining public support for new technologies and infrastructure projects is critical for successful implementation.
- **Regulatory Frameworks**: Developing clear and supportive regulatory frameworks can facilitate the transition to a low-carbon electricity sector.

### 7.8.3 Future Outlook

The future of the electricity sector will depend on the successful integration of various technologies and policies aimed at reducing emissions. Continued research and development, along with international cooperation, will be vital in achieving global climate goals.

### Figure 7.15
Figure 7.15 shows the evolution over time of transformation pathways for primary energy supply, electricity supply, and liquid fuels supply for reference scenarios and low-concentration scenarios (430 – 530 ppm CO₂eq). The development of the full scenario ensemble is further compared to the three illustrative mitigation scenarios by the ReMIND, MESSAGE, and GCAM models discussed in Section 7.11.2 (see Figure 7.10). The effect of climate policy plays out differently in each of the three supply domains. In aggregate, mitigation leads to a reduction in primary energy demands. However, two distinctly different mitigation portfolios emerge – one in which hydro-carbon fuels, including biomass, BECCS, and fossil CCS play a prominent role; and the other where, taken together, non-biomass renewables and nuclear power take center stage. In both instances, the share of fossil energy without CCS declines to less than 20% of the total by 2100. Note that in the scenarios examined here, the major branch point occurs around the 2050 period, while the foundations are laid in the 2030 to 2050 period.

Electricity generation is a somewhat different story. While as previously noted, electricity generation decarbonizes rapidly and completely (in many scenarios emissions actually become negative), taken together, non-biomass renewables and nuclear power always play an important role. The role of CCS varies greatly, but even when CCS becomes extremely important to the overall mitigation strategy, it never exceeds half of power generation. By 2050, the contribution of fossil CCS technologies is in most scenarios larger than BECCS (see Figure 7.11). In contrast to the overall scale of primary energy supply, which falls in climate policy scenarios relative to baseline scenarios, the scale of power generation can be higher in the presence of climate policy depending on whether the pace of electrification proceeds more or less rapidly than the rate of end-use energy demand reductions. With regards to the deployment of individual non-biomass renewables or different CCS technologies, see also Figure 7.11 and Figure 7.12.

Mitigation scenario studies indicate that the decarbonization of the electricity sector may be achieved at a much higher pace than in the rest of the energy system (Figure 7.14). In the majority of stringent mitigation scenarios (430 – 480 ppm and 480 – 530 ppm), the share of low-carbon energy increases from presently about 30% to more than 80% by 2050. In the long term (2100), fossil-based electricity generation without CCS is phased out entirely in these scenarios.

## Section 7.8: Relationship between short-term action and long-term targets

The relationship between near-term actions and long-term goals is complex and has received a great deal of attention in the research literature. Unlike short-lived species (e.g., CH₄, CO, NOₓ, and SO₂) for which stable concentrations are associated with stable emissions, stable concentrations of CO₂ ultimately in the long term require net emissions to decline to zero.

Two important implications follow from this observation. First, it is cumulative emissions over the entire century that to a first approximation determines the CO₂ concentration at the end of the century, and therefore no individual year’s emissions are critical. For any stable concentration of CO₂, emissions must peak and then decline toward zero, and for low concentrations, some period of negative emissions may prove necessary.

The precise relationship is subject to uncertainty surrounding processes in both the oceans and on land that govern the carbon cycle. Processes to augment ocean uptake are constrained by international agreements.

Second, minimization of global social cost implies an immediate initiation of global emissions mitigation, relative to a reference, no-climate-policy scenario, with a marginal value of carbon that rises exponentially (Hotelling, 1931; Peck and Wan, 1996). The consequence of this latter feature is that emissions abatement and the deployment of mitigation technologies grows over time. When only a long-term state, e.g., a fixed level of radiative forcing in a specific year such as 2.6 Wm² in 2100, is prescribed, the interim path can theoretically take on any value before the target year. ‘Overshoot scenarios’ are scenarios for which target values are exceeded during the period before the target date. They are possible because carbon is removed from the atmosphere by the oceans over an extended period of time, and can be further extended by the ability of society to create negative emissions through sequestration in terrestrial systems (Section 7.5, Chapter 11), production of bioenergy in conjunction with CCS technology (Section 7.5.5), and direct air capture (DAC). See for example, Edmonds, et al. (2013).

Even so, the bounded nature of the cumulative emissions associated with any long-term CO₂ concentration limit creates a derived limit on near-term emissions. Beyond some point, the system cannot adjust sufficiently to achieve the goal. Early work linking near-term actions with long-term goals was undertaken by researchers such as Swart, et al. (1998), the ‘safe landing’ concept, and Bruckner, et al. (1999), the ‘toll- four (from about 15 % to about 60 % in 20 years).

The right panel shows the rate of up-scaling for different levels of emissions in 2030 in mitigation scenarios reaching 450 to 500 (430 – 530) ppm CO₂eq concentrations by 2100. Colored bars show the interquartile range and white bars indicate the full range across the scenarios, excluding those with large net negative global emissions (> 20 GtCO₂/yr) (see Section 6.3.2 for more details). Scenarios with large net negative global emissions are shown as individual points. The arrows indicate the magnitude of zero- and low-carbon energy supply up-scaling from 2030 to 2050. Zero- and low-carbon energy supply includes renewables, nuclear energy, fossil energy with CCS, and bioenergy with CCS (BECCS). Note: Only scenarios that apply the full, unconstrained mitigation technology portfolio of the underlying models (default technology assumption) are shown. Scenarios with exogenous carbon price assumptions are excluded in both panels. In the right panel, scenarios with policies affecting the timing of mitigation other than 2030 interim targets are also excluded. Sources: WGIII AR5 Scenario Database (see Annex II.10).

### Figure 7.17 | Annual Levels of Geological Carbon Dioxide Storage in cost-effective mitigation scenarios reaching 430 – 530 ppm CO₂eq.
Source: AMPERE intermodelling comparison; Eom et al. (2013), Riahi et al. (2013). Source: Reprinted from Technological Forecasting and Social Change, Eom J. et al., “The impact of near-term climate policy choices on technology and emission transition pathways”, 2013, with permission from Elsevier.

Eom et al. (2013) indicates that such rapid transformations due to major limiting factor for CCS (see 7.11.2.), however, various concerns related to potential ecological impacts, accidental release of CO₂, and related storage effectiveness of CCS technologies might pose barriers to deployment. The study shows that depending on the assumptions about the technology portfolio, a quadrupling of the low-carbon share over 20 years (2030 – 2050) would lead on average to the construction of 29 to 107 new nuclear plants per year. While the lower-bound estimate corresponds to about the observed rate of nuclear power installations in the 1980s (Wilson et al., 2013), the high estimate is historically unprecedented. The study further indicates an enormous requirement for the future up-scaling of RE technologies. For instance, solar power is projected in the models to increase by 50 – 360 times of the year-2011 global solar capacity between 2030 and 2050.

With respect to the attainability of such high deployment rates, the recent study by Wilson et al. (2013) indicates that the diffusion of successful technologies in the past has been generally more rapid than the projected technology diffusion by integrated models. As shown in Figure 7.17, cost-effective pathways (without delay) show a remarkable near-term up-scaling (between 2008 and 2030) of CCS technologies by about three orders of magnitude from the current CCS facilities that store a total of 5 MtCO₂ per year (see also, Sathre et al., 2012). The deployment of CCS in these scenarios is projected to accelerate even further reaching CO₂ storage rates of about half to double current global CO₂ emissions from fossil fuel and industry by 2100.

The majority of the models indicate that in absence of this CCS potential, the transformation to low-GHG concentrations (about 480 ppm CO₂eq) might not be attainable if mitigation is delayed to 2030 (Riahi et al., 2013). Delays in mitigation thus reduce technology choices, and as a result some of the currently optional technologies might become ‘a must’ in the future (Riahi et al., 2012, 2013; Rogelj et al., 2013). It should be noted that even at the level of CCS deployment as depicted by the cost-effective scenarios, CO₂ storage capacity is unlikely to be a limiting factor for CCS.

### 7.12 Sectoral policies

The stabilization of GHG concentrations at a level consistent with the Cancun agreement requires a fundamental transformation of the energy supply system, and the long-term substitution of freely emitting (i.e., unabated) fossil fuel conversion technologies by low-carbon alternatives (Chapter 6, Section 7.11). Studies that have analyzed current policies plus the emission reduction pledges under the Cancun agreement have found that global GHG emissions are expected to grow (den Elzen et al., 2011; IEA, 2011a; e.g., Carraro and Massetti, 2012). As a consequence, additional policies must be enacted and/or the coverage and stringency of the existing ones must be increased if the Cancun agreement is to be fulfilled.

Currently, most countries combine instruments from three domains: economic instruments to guide investments of profit-maximizing firms, information and regulation approaches to guide choices where economic instruments are politically not feasible or not fully reflected in the satisficing behaviour of private actors, and innovation and infrastructure policies reflecting public investment in long-term transformation needs (Grubb et al., 2013). This section discusses the outcome of existing climate policies that address the energy supply sector in terms of...

## 7.12.1 Economic instruments

GHG pricing policies, such as GHG-emission trading schemes (ETS) and GHG-emission taxes, have been frequently proposed to address the market externalities associated with GHG emissions. In the power sector, GHG pricing has primarily been pursued through emission trading mechanisms and, to a lower extent, by carbon taxes. Economic instruments associated with the provision of transport fuels and heat are discussed in chapters 8 – 10.

The existence of GHG (allowance or tax) prices increases the cost of electricity from fossil-fuelled power plants and, as a consequence, average electricity prices. The short-term economic impacts of power price increases for industrial and private consumers have been widely discussed. To address the associated distributional impacts, various compensation schemes have been proposed. The impact of an emission trading scheme on the profitability of power generation can vary. Allowances that are allocated for free lead to windfall gains. With full auctioning, the impact on profitability can vary between different power stations.

From an operational point of view, what counts is the fuel- and technology-dependent mark up in the marginal costs of fossil fuel power plants due to GHG prices. Power plants with low specific GHG emissions (e.g., combined cycle gas turbines) will see a smaller increase of their marginal costs compared to those with higher specific emissions (e.g., coal power plants). The resulting influence on the relative competitiveness of different power plants and the associated effect on the generation mix depends, in part, on fuel prices (which help set the marginal cost reference levels) and the stringency of the GHG-emission cap or tax.

(a) The economic performance of nuclear power plants, for instance, can be improved by the establishment of GHG pricing schemes.

(b) CCS technologies applied in the power sector will only become competitive with their freely emitting (i.e., unabated) counterparts if the additional investment and operational costs associated with the CCS technology are compensated for by sufficiently high carbon prices.

Energy Systems

In terms of the price volatility seen in the ETS, Oda and Akimoto (2011) analyzed the influence of carbon price volatility on CCS investments and concluded that carbon prices need to be higher to compensate for the associated uncertainty. The provision of capital grants, investment tax credits, credit guarantees, and/or insurance are considered to be suitable means to support CCS technologies as long as they are in their early stages of development (IEA, 2013c).

Many RE technologies still need direct (e.g., price-based or quantity-based deployment policies) or indirect (e.g., sufficiently high carbon prices and the internalization of other externalities) support if their market shares are to be increased (see Section 7.8.2; IPCC, 2011a; IRENA, 2012a). To achieve this goal, specific RE deployment policies have been enacted in a large number of countries (Halsnæs et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012; REN21, 2013). These policies are designed to facilitate the process of bringing RE technologies down the learning curve (IEA, 2011f; IRENA, 2012a). Taken together, RE policies have been successful in driving an escalated growth in the deployment of RE (IPCC, 2011a).

Price-based mechanisms (such as feed-in tariffs (FITs)) and quantity-based systems (such as quotas or renewable portfolio standards, RPS, and tendering/bidding) are the most common RE deployment policies in the power sector (Section 15.6, Halsnæs et al., 2012; REN21, 2013). With respect to their success and efficiency, the SRREN SPM (IPCC, 2011a, p.25) notes “that some feed-in tariffs have been effective and efficient at promoting RE electricity, mainly due to the combination of long-term fixed price or premium payments, network connections, and guaranteed purchase of all RE electricity generated. Quota policies can be effective and efficient if designed to reduce risk; for example, with long-term contracts.”

Supported by Klessmann et al. (2013), however, has questioned this view and argues that CDM in its current form is not a reliable policy tool for long-term RE development plans. In addition, CCS has been accepted as an eligible measure under the CDM by the UN (IEA, 2010g).

The phaseout of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies as discussed during the G-20 summit meetings in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 will have a visible influence on global energy-related carbon emissions (Bruvoll et al., 2011; IEA, 2011g, 2013c). Removing these subsidies could lead to a 13% decline in CO₂ emissions and generate positive spillover effects by reducing global energy demand (IMF, 2013).

A renewed tendency to shift to tender-based systems with public competitive bidding to deploy renewables is observed by REN21 (2013) as well. Assessing the economic efficiency of RE policies requires a clear distinction between whether a complete macroeconomic assessment is intended (i.e., one where competing mitigation options are taken into account as well) or whether prescribed and time-dependent RE shares are to be achieved in a cost-effective manner.

In addition, the planning horizon must be clearly stated. RE policies might be considered to be inefficient in a short-term (myopic) perspective, while they could be potentially justified in an intertemporal setting where a dynamic optimization over a couple of decades is carried out (see Section 15.6, IEA).

## 7.12 Regulatory approaches

The formulation of low-carbon technologies targets can help technology companies to anticipate the scale of the market and to identify opportunities for their products and services (Lester and Neuhoff, 2009), thus, motivating investments in innovation and production facilities while reducing costs for low-carbon technologies. Currently, for instance, about 138 countries have renewable targets in place. More than half of them are developing countries (REN21, 2013). The success of energy policies heavily depends on the development of an underlying solid legal framework as well as a sufficient regulatory stability (Reiche et al., 2006; IPCC, 2011a). Property rights, contract enforcement, appropriate liability schemes, and emissions accounting are essential for a successful implementation of climate policies.

For example, well-defined responsibilities for the long-term reliability of geologic storages are an important pre-requisite for successful CCS applications (IEA, 2013c), while non-discriminatory access to the grid is of similar importance for RE.

Concerning the promotion of RE, the specific challenges that are faced by developing countries and countries with regulated markets are addressed by IRENA (2012a); IRENA, (2012b); Kahrl (2011); and Zhang et al. (2012). Renewable portfolio standards (or quota obligations, see Section 15.5.4.1) are usually combined with the trading of green certificates and therefore have been discussed under the topic of economic instruments (see Section 7.12.1). Efficiency and environmental performance standards are usual regulatory instruments applied to fossil fuel power plants.

In the field of nuclear energy, a stable policy environment comprising a regulatory and institutional framework that addresses operational safety and the appropriate management of nuclear waste as well as long-term commitments to the use of nuclear energy are requested to minimize investment risks for new nuclear power plants (NEA, 2013). To regain public acceptance after the Fukushima accident, comprehensive safety reviews have been carried out in many countries. Some of them included ‘stress tests’, which investigated the capability of existing and projected reactors to cope with extreme natural and man-made events, especially those lying outside the reactor design assumptions. As a result of the accident and the subsequent investigations, a “radical revision of the worst-case assumptions for safety planning” is expected to occur (Rogner, 2013).

## 7.12.3 Information programmes

Though information programs play a minor role in the field of power plant-related energy efficiency improvements and fossil fuel switching, awareness creation, capacity building, and information dissemination to stakeholders outside of the traditional power plant sector plays an important role especially in the use of decentralized RE in LDCs (IRENA, 2012c). Other low-carbon technologies like CCS and nuclear would require specifically trained personnel. Furthermore, enhanced transparency of information improves public and private decisions and can enhance public perception.

## 7.12.4 Government provision of public goods or services

Public energy-related R&D expenditures in the IEA countries peaked in 2009 as a result of economic stimulus packages, but soon after suffered a substantial decline. Although R&D spending is now again rising, energy-related expenditures still account for less than 5% of total government R&D – compared to 11% that was observed in 1980 (IEA, 2012j). Nuclear has received significant support in many countries and the share of research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) for RE has increased, but public R&D for CCS is lower, and does not reflect its potential importance for the achievement of negative emissions (von Stechow et al., 2011; Scott et al., 2013).

Although private R&D expenditures are seldom disclosed, they are estimated to represent a large share of the overall spending for RD&D activities (IEA, 2012j). Private R&D investments are not only stimulated by R&D policies. Additional policies (e.g., deployment policies) addressing other parts of the innovation chain as well as broad GHG pricing policies might assist in triggering private investments in R&D (IPCC, 2011a; Rogge et al., 2011; Battelle, 2012).

The integration of variable RE poses additional challenges, as discussed earlier, with a variety of possible technical and institutional responses. Many of these technical and institutional measures require an enabling regulatory framework facilitating their application. Infrastructure challenges, e.g., grid extension, are particularly acute.

## 7.12.5 Voluntary actions

Voluntary agreements have been frequently applied in various sectors around the globe, though they often have been replaced by mandatory schemes in the long-term. According to Chapter 15, their success is mixed. “Voluntary agreements had a positive effect on energy efficiency improvements, but results in terms of GHG emissions reductions have been modest, with the exception of Japan, where the status of these voluntary agreements has also been much more ‘binding’ than in other countries in line with Japanese cultural traditions.”

## 7.13 Gaps in knowledge and data

Gaps in knowledge and data are addressed to identify those that can be closed through additional research and others that are inherent to the problems discussed and are therefore expected to persist. Chapter 7 is confronted by various gaps in knowledge, especially those related to methodological issues and availability of data:

- The diversity of energy statistic and GHG emission accounting methodologies as well as several years delay in the availability of energy statistics data limit reliable descriptions of current and historic energy use and emission data on a global scale.
- Although fundamental problems in identifying fossil fuel and nuclear resource deposits, the extent of potential carbon storage sites, and technical potentials of RE are acknowledged, the development of unified and consistent reporting schemes, the collection of additional field data, and further geological modelling activities could reduce the currently existing uncertainties.
- There is a gap in our knowledge concerning fugitive CH₄ emissions as well as adverse environmental side effects associated with the increasing exploitation of unconventional fossil fuels. As novel technologies are applied in these fields, research could help reduce the gap. Operational and supply chain risks of nuclear power plants, the safety of CCS storage sites and adverse side effects.

## 7.14 Frequently Asked Questions

**FAQ 7.1 How much does the energy supply sector contribute to the GHG emissions?**

The energy supply sector comprises all energy extraction, conversion, storage, transmission, and distribution processes with the exception of those that use final energy in the demand sectors (industry, transport, and building). In 2010, the energy supply sector was responsible for 46% of all energy-related GHG emissions and 35% of anthropogenic GHG emissions, up from 22% in 1970.

## 第 59 部分

## Chapter 7

In the last 10 years, the growth of GHG emissions from the energy supply sector has outpaced the growth of all anthropogenic GHG emissions by nearly 1% per year. Most of the primary energy delivered to the sector is transformed into a diverse range of final energy products including electricity, heat, refined oil products, coke, enriched coal, and natural gas. A significant amount of energy is used for transformation, making the sector the largest consumer of energy. Energy use in the sector results from end-user demand for higher-quality energy carriers such as electricity, but also the relatively low average global efficiency of energy conversion and delivery processes.

Increasing demand for high-quality energy carriers by end users in many developing countries has resulted in significant growth in the sector’s GHG emissions, particularly as much of this growth has been fuelled by the increased use of coal in Asia, mitigated to some extent by increased use of gas in other regions and the continued uptake of low-carbon technologies. While total output from low-carbon technologies, such as hydro, wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, and nuclear power, has continued to grow, their share of global primary energy supply has remained relatively constant; fossil fuels have maintained their dominance and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) has yet to be applied to electricity production at scale.

Biomass and hydropower dominate renewable energy, particularly in developing countries where biomass remains an important source of energy for heating and cooking; per capita emissions from many developing countries remain lower than the global average. Renewable energy accounts for one-fifth of global electricity production, with hydroelectricity taking the largest share. Importantly, the last 10 years have seen significant growth in both wind and solar, which combine to deliver around one-tenth of all renewable electricity. Nuclear energy’s share of electricity production declined from a maximum peak of 17% in 1993 to 11% in 2012.

### FAQ 7.2 What are the main mitigation options in the energy supply sector?

The main mitigation options in the energy supply sector are energy efficiency improvements, the reduction of fugitive non-CO₂ GHG emissions, switching from (unabated) fossil fuels with high specific GHG emissions (e.g., coal) to those with lower ones (e.g., natural gas), use of renewable energy, use of nuclear energy, and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS).

No single mitigation option in the energy supply sector will be sufficient to hold the increase in global average temperature change below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. A combination of some, but not necessarily all, of the options is needed. Significant emission reductions can be achieved by energy-efficiency improvements and fossil fuel switching, but they are not sufficient by themselves to provide the deep cuts needed. Achieving deep cuts will require more intensive use of low-GHG technologies such as renewable energy, nuclear energy, and CCS.

### Energy Systems

Using electricity to substitute for other fuels in end-use sectors plays an important role in deep emission cuts, since the cost of decarbonizing power generation is expected to be lower than that in other parts of the energy supply sector.

While the combined global technical potential of low-carbon technologies is sufficient to enable deep cuts in emissions, there are local and regional constraints on individual technologies. The contribution of mitigation technologies depends on site- and context-specific factors such as resource availability, mitigation and integration costs, co-benefits/adverse side effects, and public perception. Infrastructure and integration challenges vary by mitigation technology and region. While these challenges are not in general technically insurmountable, they must be carefully considered in energy supply planning and operations to ensure reliable and affordable energy supply.

### FAQ 7.3 What barriers need to be overcome in the energy supply sector to enable a transformation to low-GHG emissions?

The principal barriers to transforming the energy supply sector are mobilizing capital investment; lock-in to long-lived high-carbon systems; cultural, institutional, and legal aspects; human capital; and lack of perceived clarity about climate policy.

Though only a fraction of available private-sector capital investment would be needed to cover the costs of future low-GHG energy supply, a range of mechanisms — including climate investment funds, carbon pricing, removal of fossil fuel subsidies, and private/public initiatives aimed at lowering barriers for investors — need to be utilized to direct investment towards energy supply. Long-lived fossil energy system investments represent an effective (high-carbon) lock-in. The relative lack of existing energy capital in many developing countries therefore provides opportunities to develop a low-carbon energy system.

A holistic approach encompassing cultural, institutional, and legal issues in the formulation and implementation of energy supply strategies is essential, especially in areas of urban and rural poverty where conventional market approaches are insufficient. Human capital capacity building — encompassing technological, project planning, and institutional and public engagement elements — is required to develop a skilled workforce and to facilitate widespread adoption of renewable, nuclear, CCS, and other low-GHG energy supply options.

Elements of an effective policy aimed at achieving deep cuts in CO₂ emissions would include a global carbon-pricing scheme supplemented by technology support, regulation, and institutional development tailored to the needs of individual countries (notably less-developed countries).

## Section 7.8: Carbon Capture and Storage

### 7.8.1 Overview of Carbon Capture Technologies

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technology that captures carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions produced from the use of fossil fuels in electricity generation and stores it underground to prevent it from entering the atmosphere. The process involves three main steps:

1. **Capture**: CO₂ is separated from other gases produced in industrial processes.
2. **Transport**: The captured CO₂ is transported to a storage site, usually via pipelines.
3. **Storage**: The CO₂ is injected into geological formations for long-term storage.

### 7.8.2 Current Status of CCS Projects

As of 2020, there are several large-scale CCS projects operating worldwide. These projects demonstrate the feasibility of CCS technology and its potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Key projects include:

- **Sleipner**: Located in Norway, this project has been operational since 1996 and has successfully stored over 20 million tonnes of CO₂.
- **Gorgon**: An Australian project that aims to capture and store 4 million tonnes of CO₂ annually.

### 7.8.3 Challenges and Opportunities

Despite the progress made, CCS faces several challenges:

- **Cost**: The high cost of capturing and storing CO₂ remains a significant barrier to widespread adoption.
- **Public Acceptance**: There are concerns about the safety and environmental impact of storing CO₂ underground.

However, opportunities exist to enhance the deployment of CCS through:

- **Policy Support**: Government incentives and regulations can promote investment in CCS technologies.
- **Research and Development**: Continued innovation can lead to more efficient and cost-effective CCS solutions.
