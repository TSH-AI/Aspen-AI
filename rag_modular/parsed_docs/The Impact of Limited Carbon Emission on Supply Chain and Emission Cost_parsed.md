## Abstract

Nowadays, the effects of global warming are at a critical point and have threatened the destruction of the earth’s ecosystems. The most dangerous cause of global warming is carbon. This problem seriously forces the countries of the world to focus on reducing carbon emissions. The commitments are binding for all countries, so they have limited CO₂. Transportation is one of the largest sources of emissions from activities in the supply chain. The transportation issue should be investigated at the same time inventory decisions are made to minimize supply chain costs. The modes of transport considered in this study are trucks that are distributed from the multi-supplier to the warehouse. The purpose of this model is to observe the impact of the application of carbon emission policies, such as carbon cap (limited) and carbon tax on the decision variables. The changes in the parameters of emissions affect the quantity of emissions, the total cost of the system, and the total cost of emissions.

## Section 7.8: Detailed Analysis of Emissions

### 7.8.1 Emission Sources
The primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions include:
- Transportation
- Industry
- Agriculture

### 7.8.2 Mitigation Strategies
To reduce emissions, the following strategies are recommended:
1. Transition to renewable energy sources.
2. Improve energy efficiency in industrial processes.
3. Implement sustainable agricultural practices.

### 7.8.3 Future Projections
Future projections indicate a potential increase in emissions if current trends continue. It is crucial to adopt aggressive mitigation strategies to curb this trend.
