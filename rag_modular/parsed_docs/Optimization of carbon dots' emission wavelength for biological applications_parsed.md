# Optimization of Carbon Dots' Emission Wavelength for Biological Applications

## Section 7.8: Detailed Analysis of Carbon Dots

### 7.8.1 Emission Wavelength Optimization

The optimization of the emission wavelength of carbon dots (CDs) is crucial for their application in biological imaging. The following parameters were analyzed:

- **Size of Carbon Dots**: The size of the carbon dots significantly affects their emission properties. Smaller dots tend to emit at shorter wavelengths, while larger dots emit at longer wavelengths.
- **Surface Functionalization**: The chemical groups attached to the surface of the carbon dots can alter their electronic properties, thus affecting the emission wavelength.
- **Solvent Effects**: The choice of solvent can influence the emission characteristics of carbon dots. Polar solvents tend to stabilize certain electronic states, leading to shifts in emission wavelengths.

### 7.8.2 Experimental Results

The experimental results are summarized in Table 7.8.1 below:

**TABLE 7.8.1: Emission Wavelengths of Carbon Dots Under Various Conditions**

| Condition                     | Emission Wavelength (nm) | Size (nm) | Surface Functionalization |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| Pure Carbon Dots              | 450                      | 2         | None                      |
| Carbon Dots with -COOH       | 480                      | 3         | Carboxylic Acid           |
| Carbon Dots with -NH₂        | 500                      | 4         | Amine                     |
| Carbon Dots in Ethanol        | 470                      | 3         | None                      |
| Carbon Dots in Water          | 460                      | 2.5       | None                      |

### 7.8.3 Discussion

The results indicate that both size and surface functionalization play significant roles in determining the emission wavelength of carbon dots. The data suggests that:

- **Size Control**: By controlling the size of the carbon dots, researchers can fine-tune the emission wavelength for specific applications.
- **Functionalization**: Surface modifications can be strategically employed to achieve desired optical properties, enhancing the utility of carbon dots in biological applications.

In conclusion, the optimization of carbon dots' emission wavelengths is a multifaceted process that requires careful consideration of various physical and chemical parameters.

# Carbon Quantum Dots for Biological Applications

**Authors:** Keenan J Mintz, University of Miami, Chemistry

**Keywords:** Carbon Dots, Bioimaging, Neuroblastoma

**Abstract:**
Carbon quantum dots (CDs) are a type of nanomaterial discovered in the first years of the 21st century. They have been widely studied due to their easily modified surface, bright and stable photoluminescence, and low toxicity. Due to these advantageous properties, CDs have been applied in fields such as drug delivery, bioimaging, light emitting diodes, and 3D-printing. One drawback of the use of CDs in biological systems is the normal blue or green wavelength of emission. Any attempt to track or image these particles through their emission *in vivo* is difficult as the CDs’ photoluminescence is reabsorbed by the tissue or interfered with through autofluorescence. To improve CDs’ capabilities, it would be highly advantageous to shift their emission to the red region of light (ca. 700 nm). Herein, several strategies are presented to accomplish this purpose. CDs have been prepared from a dye (Evans blue) and protein (bovine serum albumin) complex, through reaction in sulfuric acid and other acidic and oxidative species, and by coordination with lanthanide metals. These reactions all endeavor to produce CDs which possess red photoluminescence in aqueous solutions. From the results of these reactions, a great deal can be learned regarding how pyrolysis breaks down the structure of both dye and protein to produce CDs and how this impacts emission wavelength. Furthermore, the cooperative nature of acidic and oxidative properties has been observed in the preparation of CDs which possess red emission, but only in organic solvents. These preparation pathways present an opportunity to obtain CDs’ desired properties as well as understand the underlying principles relating to their formation and photoluminescence mechanism.
